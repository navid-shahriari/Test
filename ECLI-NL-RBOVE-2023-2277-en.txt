The preliminary relief judge dealt with the request on 12 June 2023 at the hearing.The applicant was present, assisted by his authorized representative.On behalf of the defendant, his authorized representative participated in the hearing.[interested party 1] and [interested party 2] were also present at the hearing.No one has appeared on behalf of [interested party 3].
Assessment by the preliminary relief judge
Prior to
1. The judgment of the preliminary relief judge has a provisional character and does not bind the court in the soil proceedings.
Cause
2.1
By letter of 15 April 2021, [interested party 1], also on behalf of other local residents, asked the defendant to take enforcement action against the renovation of the building at the [address] in [place] (the building).In this request, the local residents state that the building is being converted into four independent housing units and ask to immediately impose a building stop.The local residents also ask the defendant in this enforcement request to investigate whether it is true that the building will be used for assisted living by clients of [interested party 3] and whether that is permitted according to the zoning plan.In addition, the local residents indicated that they see the arrival of another guided-living initiative in the neighborhood, in addition to the high percentage of student housing, as undesirable for the quality of life of the neighborhood.
2.2
In response to an earlier report from [interested party 1], a supervisor of the municipality of Zwolle had already inspected the building on 9 April 2021.By e-mail of 23 April 2021, that regulator announced the findings he made to [interested party 1] during that inspection.In particular, based on these findings and internal research into the planning situation of the plot [address], the defendant subsequently made the primary decision.
2.3
After [interested party 1] and [interested party 2] had objected to the primary decision, the supervisor re -inspected the building on December 21, 2021 and 19 April 2022.On the basis of these inspections, among other things, the defendant concluded that the building has been inhabited since about 8 June 2021 by four care clients of [interested party 3].To make this use possible, the building on the back on the ground floor has been expanded and additional facilities have been installed in the four existing rooms.An existing, permitted extension has been demolished for building the (new) extension.Each living room now contains its own kitchen with cooking facilities, a toilet and a sink.Furthermore, a common bathroom has been realized on the ground floor.This was done without applying for an environmental permit and granted.
2.4On 19 May 2022, the Spatial Planning Department of the municipality of Zwolle drawn up an advice on the habitation of the building by four clients of [interested party 3].It has been considered that the plot [address] has the destination "Wonen" according to the "ASSENDORP" zoning plan and that the use of the building for room housing is contrary to this destination.However, it was concluded in this advice that the building may be inhabited on the basis of the transitional law of the 'Assendorp' zoning plan by three room residents or households and that room housing is also permitted by three care clients based on that transitional law, provided that the emphasis is on living.According to the Spatial Planning Department, the use by four care clients is not permitted, because that provides intensification of the use that conflicts with the destination, which is not allowed according to the transitional law.As a result, the indoor and exhaustive renovations are also in the service of that conflicting use in violation of the zoning plan.Furthermore, the Spatial Planning Department in the advice of
19 May 2022 concluded that no cooperation can be provided in deviation from the "Assendorp" zoning plan for the use of the building by four care clients and the renovations that make that use possible.
2.5
On July 26, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Objections of the Municipality of Zwolle issued an advisory advice on the objections of [interested party 1] and [interested party 2].Partly as a result of this advice, the defendant asked [interested party 3] about the method of habitation of the building and the degree of guidance of care clients in the building.
2.6
Subsequently, a so -called advance announcement was sent to the applicant and [interested party 3] on 5 October 2022, in which the defendant stated that he intends to impose an order subject to a penalty.Against this intention, the applicant submitted views by letters of 4 November 2022 and 28 February 2023,
who were then supplemented with an e-mail of 6 March 2023.
2.7
Subsequently, the defendant took the four (partial) decisions on objection.
The order of penalty payments
3. In the (sub) decision addressed to the applicant on Objection (hereinafter: the contested decision), the defendant imposed the following order subject to a penalty:
Mandate 1 (use):
Before 24 June 2023, the applicant must terminate and terminate the violation of Article 2.1, first paragraph, preamble and under c, of the General Provisions on Environmental Law Act (Wabo).The applicant can do this by permanently reducing the occupation of the building to a maximum of three separate households.
The defendant has associated a penalty of € 1,500 per week, with a maximum of € 15,000.
Mandate 2 (construction):
The applicant must terminate and terminate the violation of Article 2.1, first paragraph, preamble and under a and c, of the Wabo before 24 June 2023.The applicant can do this by:
1. permanently remove the expansion at the rear of the building;and
2. In one of the four (non-independent) living spaces to remove and keep the housing facilities built without an environmental permit.This means that the applicant must remove the toilet, the kitchen and the washbasin in at least one of the four (non -independent) living spaces, including removing or depicting the pipework.
The defendant has associated a penalty of € 1,000 per week, with a maximum of € 10,000.
The request to make a provisional provision
4. The applicant asks the preliminary relief judge to suspend the contested decision up to twelve weeks after the court ruled in the soil procedure.The applicant is of the opinion that this temporary measure is necessary, because it is not certain that the burdens are lawfully imposed, while they will have a disproportionate effect for him and one of the residents.To substantiate this, the applicant argues that he has concluded a lease for the duration of ten years with [interested party 3] and that he has the obligation to accommodate four residents on that basis.Failure to meet these obligations will have negative consequences.According to the applicant, the social interest also plays a role in this, because it concerns residents with a certain vulnerability and there is a huge shortage in the housing market.Furthermore, the applicant states that if he has to perform the second mandate, he will suffer a disproportionate amount of damage.The costs for complying with the second mandate treasurer, based on a statement from his architectural adviser, at around € 180,000.In addition, complying with the burden, according to the applicant, will take a lot of time, among other things because a contractor must be found for carrying out the renovation work.Assessment of the request to suspend the order subject to penalty payments
The substantive views of the parties
5.1
The defendant takes the position that the reference moment for transitional law is 13 February 2001, the date of entry into force of the previous zoning plan "Assendorp-Pierik".On that date, three people were registered at the address of the building in the Basic Registration of Persons (BRP) and the building was inhabited by three people.That is why Kamerwoning may be continued by three residents/households in the building, despite the fact that this is contrary to the now applicable destination, on the basis of the transitional law of the "Assendorp-Pierik" zoning plan and then the "Assendorp" zoning plan.According to the defendant, the four rooms that are present in the building after the renovation are still non -independent living spaces, which are now being used for almost independent habitation by the four clients of [interested party 3].According to the defendant, this use is still covered by the protection of the transitional law, with the exception of the fourth resident.In addition, the defendant has established information provided by [interested party 3] that a form of living takes place in the building that fits within the residential destination, because the emphasis is not on providing care and guidance to the residents.Furthermore, the defendant takes the position that the internal renovation and construction of the extension are in violation of the zoning plan, because it is intended to make room residence possible by four people/ households and for a larger surface of the building contrary to the destinationto use.As a result, an environmental permit is required for that work on the basis of Article 5, second paragraph, of Annex II of the Environmental Law Decree (BOR).Furthermore, with reference to the "Policy rule for independent living space" (the policy rule), the defendant is not willing to cooperate in the expansion of room housing in the building of three to four people.
5.2
In his notice of appeal against the contested decision, the applicant, among other things, summarizes that the construction meets the rules of permit -free building from the Bor.Furthermore, the "Zwolle, Umbrella Plan Self -employed living space" zoning plan follows that several homes in a building may be permitted if the criteria from the policy rule are met.According to the applicant, there is still non -independent living spaces in this case and they are not in violation of the zoning plan.There is no question of a violation, because the building has been set up by four people since 1986 and has been regularly inhabited by four people since 1995, including in the period from 2011 to 2015. That is why the habitation leadsFrom the building by four care clients of [interested party 3], according to the applicant not to a more intensive use or to a change in the use permitted under the transitional law.In addition, according to him, the question is whether the defendant was right to determine the reference moment for the transitional law on 13 February 2001. He is of the opinion that a reasonable interpretation of the transitional law means that it is assumed that room residence has been permitted by four people/households in the building.
If it is considered that there is a violation, then the applicant is of the opinion that there is a concrete view of legalization and that the imposed order due to a penalty is disproportionate in relation to the goals to be served with it.In that context, he also appeals to the principle of trust and the principle of equality.Furthermore, according to the applicant, the two burdens are contradictory.If he returns the occupation of the building to three households, mandate 2 is unnecessary or no longer has a reasonable interest.The extension and the indoor renovation are then permit -free or can be legalized, according to the applicant.
5.3
[interested party 1] and [interested party 2] (hereinafter referred to as: local residents) are of the opinion that four independent living spaces have been realized due to the indoor activities carried out in the building.According to them, the fact that the four rooms do not have their own shower does not make this different.In addition, local residents are of the opinion that the building is now being used to accommodate specific target groups.This use is no longer protected by the transitional law, because it is spatially a different use than room housing by (three) persons/households, according to local residents.
Testing by the preliminary relief judge
6.1The preliminary relief judge is of the opinion that this dispute is not suitable for giving a provisional substantive opinion.The dispute is too complex for that and in advance is not evident which party is right in this case.The court will have to make a decision about this in the soil procedure and the professions of local residents and [interested party 3].In the opinion of the preliminary relief judge, in the opinion of the preliminary relief judge, there is also no possibility of applying Article 8:86, first paragraph, of the General Administrative Law Act (Awb) in this decision to immediately rule on the applicant's appeal, now againstThe four (part) decide on objection of 24 March 2023 three other professions in addition to that of the applicant.
The preliminary relief judge will therefore not assess the views of the parties, but on the basis of a consideration of the interests of the parties involved, assess whether the making of a provisional provision is justified.Based on this, the preliminary relief judge will come to the next judgment.
6.2
The preliminary relief judge considers the execution of mandate 2 (construction) before the professions has been decided.Apart from whether the execution of that mandate actually costs € 180,000, it is not realistic because of the costs and work that must be carried out to demand the applicant that he breaks down the extension and removes the housing facilities in one of the rooms, before theCourt has given a substantive opinion on his appeal.It is also important that local residents at the hearing confirmed that for them the greatest pain is not in the physical renovation.The preliminary relief judge will therefore suspend mandate 2 (construction) until the court has ruled on the applicant's appeal.The suspension of this mandate up to twelve weeks after the court has made a decision in the soil procedure, as the applicant has requested, is not possible on the basis of Article 8:85, second paragraph, opening words and under c, of the Awb.
6.3
With regard to mandate 1 (use), it has not become plausible that it will have irreversible consequences.The preliminary relief judge probably considers it that one of the current residents of the building can come to other living space via [interested party 3], whether or not temporarily.Furthermore, it has not been shown that this has such a major financial consequences for the applicant that the decision on his profession cannot be awaited.Furthermore, it is important that local residents state that they are nuisance from the current residents of the building and that it would save if there were not four but three residents.In view of these interests, the preliminary relief judge honors the request to suspend mandate 1 (use) until the court has not ruled on the applicant's appeal.
However, the preliminary relief judge will extend the favorable period associated with that mandate to six weeks after the date of this decision, to give [interested party 3] and the relevant resident more time to find other living space.
Conclusion and consequences
7.1
The preliminary relief judge will partially grant the request and the provisional provision that mandate 2 (construction) is suspended from the contested decision until the court has ruled on the applicant's appeal.With regard to mandate 1 (use), the preliminary relief judge will extend the favoring period to six weeks after the date of this decision.
7.2
Because the preliminary relief judge partially assigns the request, the defendant must reimburse the court fees to the applicant.In addition, the applicant also receives a reimbursement of his costs of the proceedings, which exclusively consist of the costs of legal assistance provided professionally by a third party.The reimbursement for these costs sets the preliminary relief judge at € 1,674 (1 point for submitting the request for provisional provision and 1 point before the appearance at the hearing; value per point: € 837; weighting factor 1).
