The proceedings at first instance
For the proceedings at first instance, the Court of Appeal refers to the decision of the Central Netherlands Court, location Utrecht, of 6 April 2020, pronounced under the aforementioned case number.At this decision, the court pronounced the divorce between the parties and further, insofar as relevant here, decided in stock that the man will pay an amount of € 506,610 to the woman in the context of the bridal gift, as an equivalent of 600Bahare-Azadi gold coins, which amount will be increased by the statutory interest if the man has not paid this amount to the woman within two weeks after the service of this decision.
2. The appeal in appeal in the main proceedings and with regard to the request for suspension
2.1
The course of the procedure is evident from:
- the appeal also request for suspension with productions, received on 26 April 2020;
- the defense also incidental appeal in the main proceedings, also a defense against the request for suspension;
- A journal report from Ahmadi of 21 June 2020 with a pleading memorandum and appendices.
2.2
The oral treatment took place on June 23, 2020.The man has been represented by his lawyer.The woman appeared in person, assisted by her lawyer.
3
The reasons for the decision
3.1
The issue of the man's request is to order the suspension of the operation of the contested decision of 6 April 2020, insofar as it concerns the decision on the bridal gift.The woman is a substantiated defense against this.
3.2
The man and the woman are married [in] 2015 in [B], Iran.They both have Iranian nationality.At the time of the submission of the divorce request, both parties had their regular stay in the Netherlands.Like the court, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the Dutch court has jurisdiction with regard to the divorce and with regard to the related side facilities.The Court of Appeal is also of the opinion that the request on the bridal gift is a secondary provision within the meaning of Article 827, paragraph 1, sub f of the Code of Civil Procedure, because the request sees a regulation of the consequences of the divorce.
3.3
Appeal suspends the operation, unless the decision has been declared enforceable in stock.Pursuant to Article 360, paragraph 2, second sentence, of the Code of Civil Procedure (Rv), the higher court, if an appeal has been lodged, can still suspend the operation.
3.4
The Court puts the following first with reference to HR December 20, 2019, ECLI: NL: HR: 2019: 2026.
a. The starting point is that a pronounced conviction, hanging a higher provision, must be enforceable and can be implemented without the condition of security.Deviation from this principle can be justified by circumstances that mean that the interest of the convicted person has not been decided on the legal remedy in the event of the existence of the existing situation, or his interest in the event of certainty, also given this principle, weighs heavier than the interestof the person who has obtained the conviction in the judgment to be enforced, with the feasibility in stock thereof or in this feasibility without the condition of security being attached to it.b.When applying the measure referred to under a, an incident or in summary proceedings should be assumed by the decisions to be executed and the underlying findings and judgments, and remains the chance of success of the against thatdecision -made or still to be used legal remedy, on the understanding that the court can involve in its judgment or the decision (s) to be implemented (s) is based on a manicide.
c.If the decision on the enforceability in stock in the exported judgment is reasoned, the applicant must, apart from the case that this decision is based on an obvious mistake, the basis for his request on facts and circumstances on which when taking thesedecision could not be taken into account because they only occurred after the ruling concerned and that they can justify that the earlier decision is being deviated from.
3.5
The Court of Appeal finds that the court has declared the contested decision with regard to the bridal gift enforceable in stock without a further statement of reasons.The Court of Appeal will therefore assess the suspension request with due observance of the assessment criteria mentioned above under a and b.
3.6
The starting point is that the contested decision with regard to the bridal gift may be implemented, unless the man's interest in deviating from this principle outweighs the interest of the woman in the execution of the decision.The Court of Appeal is of the opinion that in view of the circumstances of the case the man's interest in suspending the execution outweighs the interests of women.To this end, the Court considers the following.
3.7
The parties do not disagree that they have agreed a bridal gift of 600 Bahare-Azadi gold coins at the time of the marriage closure.The discussion of the parties relates to the way in which the woman's claim must be settled on the fulfillment of that agreement.The parties differ from insight into the value of the coins in euros and about the way in which and in what form the woman (part) can receive (part) of her claim.The statements of parties on this subject will be assessed by the Court in the soil procedure.
3.8
The man explained that he came to the Netherlands with a work visa.He is severely taxed psychologically due to the problems with the woman and the legal proceedings and has taken unpaid leave at the request of his employer.The man's lawyer stated during the oral treatment that the man cannot handle the situation and therefore did not appear in person.The man currently has no income and she advised him to contact his employer and to report sick because of the problems.The man is not wealthy and at the moment unable to be able to pay any amount to the woman, the balance of his bank account is currently € 23.46.
Although the Court does not have a complete inspection of the man's financial situation, it is sufficiently plausible for the Court that the man is currently unable to do the amount of € 506,610 set by the court in the contested decision to the womanand that he is brought into a very difficult situation (state of emergency) in the event of an enforcement.
During the oral hearing, the woman stated that she thinks that the man in the Netherlands does not have financial resources to be able to pay a considerable amount to her.She states that the man in Iran may have money, but that statement is not substantiated in any way.
The fact that the woman came to the Netherlands in the context of family reunification and was financially dependent on the man does not change the foregoing.The Court of Appeal does not consider the residence status of the woman to be relevant in the context of these proceedings.The fact that the woman is currently staying with her sister and is also maintained by this sister, is of course an undesirable situation and in the opinion of the Court of Appeal that the Court of Appeal does not mean that the contested decision with regard to the bridal gift may be implementedare laid.
3.9
On the basis of the above consideration, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the request of the man to order suspension must be granted and therefore decides as follows.
