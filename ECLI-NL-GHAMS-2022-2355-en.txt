- [child 1] (hereinafter: [child 1]), [in] 2004, and
- [child 2] (hereinafter: [child 2]), [in] 2008.
The marriage of the parents was dissolved on 3 November 2009 by registering the divorce decision in the registers of the Civil Registry.After the divorce, the parents got a relationship with each other again.From that relationship were born:
- [child 3] (hereinafter: [child 3]), [in] 2012, and
- [child 4] (hereinafter: [child 4]), [in] 2019.

The size of the dispute
4.1
At the contested decision, insofar as currently relevant, it was determined at the request of the man that the parents are charged together with the exercise of the authority over [child 3] and [child 4].The woman's request to determine single -headed authority with regard to [child 1] and [child 2] has been rejected.
In addition, the court has established a provisional care scheme between the man and [child 3] and [child 4] and the request for determining a final care scheme arrested until a date to be determined.
4.2
The woman requests, with the annulment of the contested decision, to allocate her request to allocate her with the single authority over [child 2] and the man's request to tax him together with the authority about[child 3] and [child 4] to be rejected.
The woman also asked the court to decide otherwise on the care scheme between the man and [child 3] and [child 4], with the annulment of the contested decision on this point.
4.3
The man asks to ratify the contested decision, possibly with improving land, and to order the woman to pay the costs of the appeal procedure.
5
The reasons for the decision
5.1
After the contested decision, by decision of the court of 4 May 2022, a new provisional care scheme was determined between the man and the youngest two children and the request to determine a definitive care scheme (again) was maintained pending the results of a by the partiestrajectory (parenthood remains) to improve their communication.
At the hearing on appeal, the woman withdrew her request with regard to the care scheme between the man and the youngest two children.It is therefore no longer necessary to decide at that request.
5.2Before the complaints of the woman with regard to authority, [child 2], [child 3] and [child 4] are at the assessment.In short, the woman wants to get the one -headed authority over them (in the case of [child 2]) or retain it (in the case of [child 3] and [child 4]), because she and the man have serious communication problems that makethat they cannot discuss important matters.The woman fears that the children will be clamped or will be lost if she has to share the authority with the man or that - after the court understands - joint authority is otherwise contrary to their interest.
The man put forward a defense and the Council referred to the opinion of the Court of Appeal at the hearing on appeal.
5.3
The documents and the proceedings at the hearing show that the relationship between the parents is seriously disturbed.They have great difficulty communicating (constructively) with each other, among other things due to a lack of trust over and over again.Furthermore, between them the issue of which of both receives the tenancy law of the joint home.This causes great tensions.Among other things, in May 2021, that issue led to upscaling by the parent and child team to youth protection region [place A].The latter subsequently used assistance that has not so far not provided a better relationship between the parents.An attempt to get started with parenthood is stranded.In the meantime, the parents are willing to make a second attempt.At the hearing it turned out that the woman has already registered with Timon.The man has promised to register.If this time the parents do succeed in continuing to complete the parenthood process, they are expected to be better able to make decisions of any interest in joint consultations.The fact that they are willing to make a new attempt means that the Court still sees sufficient opportunities for joint authority.That is why it cannot be said at this stage that the problems between the parents are so serious that there is an unacceptable risk that the children will clamp or will be lost between the parents and that it is not to be expected that this will improve this within the foreseeable future or thatunemployed authority of the woman is otherwise necessary in the interest of the children (Article 253c (2) of the Dutch Civil Code and Article 253n JO. Article 251a of the Dutch Civil Code).It is true that the parents cannot or will not be able to communicate directly with each other, but that did not lead to no decisions about the children.Contrary to what the woman states, it has not been shown that the man has frustrated authority decisions.He sent the permission form for a foreign trip of [child 2] signed within a few days and also for the extension of the passport of [child 3] the man gave his permission.In that sense, the woman is therefore not impeded in her task as a caring parent.
Finally, when it is taken into account that the principle of the law is that authority on children is jointly exercised by the parents, the Court of Appeal comes to the conclusion that the court is right to request the man's request to jointly with the authority of [child 3] and [child 4] has granted and also rightly the request of the woman to end the joint authority over [child 2] and to tax her with the single authority.The Court of Appeal will therefore ratify the decision of which appeals to these points.
5.4
Now that the parents are (former) spouses and the proceedings are authority over their minor children, they must both bear their own costs of the proceedings.The man's request for a cost order of the woman will therefore be rejected.
5.5
This leads to the next decision.

The decision
The Council:
ratifies the decision of which appeals, insofar as the parents are responsible for the authority of [child 3] and [child 4];
ratifies the decision of which appeals, insofar as the woman's request to tax her with the single authority over [child 2], has been rejected;
rejects the requested more or otherwise on appeal.
