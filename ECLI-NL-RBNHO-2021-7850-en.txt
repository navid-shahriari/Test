Finally, a judgment was determined.

The case in short
2.1.
Parties are ex-spouses.[plaintiff] claims that [defendant] issues a bridal gift agreed under Iranian law of 761 Golden Yek Bahar Azadi.[defendant] disputes that he is obliged to do this.[Plaintiff] also states that he is entitled to half of the capacity accrued by [defendant] during the marriage and thus to the added value of the home of [defendant].For that reason, [plaintiff] claims to determine that [defendant] must sell his home.
2.2.
The court first rules that the Dutch court is competent and that Iranian law applies.The court then stipulates that [defendant] 761 Golden Yek Bahar Azadi must hand over coins to [plaintiff].In the opinion of the court, there is a foundation to be able to oblige [defendant] to sell his home.
3
The facts
3.1.
Parties were married on 24 May 2007 in Iran.Parties both have Dutch and Iranian nationality.
3.2.
By decision of the Court of The Hague of 11 June 2018, the divorce between the parties was pronounced in the Netherlands and the division of the marriage community was pronounced.By decision of 2 October 2019, the Court of Appeal of The Hague annulled the decision of the court of 11 June 2018 insofar as the court has established the division of the marriage community and again legitimate the requests and claims of the parties to and forth in the context of the division/Settlement of matrimonial power rejected.The decision of the court has been ratified for the rest.
3.3.
The divorce decision was registered in the designated registers on 12 February 2020.
3.4.
On October 30, 2019, the divorce was pronounced between the parties by the family court in Iran.That decision was confirmed by the Iranian professional judge on 4 August 2020 and by the Iranian Supreme Court on December 9, 2020.

The dispute
4.1.
[plaintiff] progresses by judgment, as far as possible enforceable in stock:
I. Primary to determine that [defendant] must hand over to [plaintiff] 761 Golden Yek (1) Bahar Azadi coins with the following specific information: Size 1, with a weight of 8,13598 (g), with a net weight of pure gold 7.32238(G), 22 mm with the purity of 0.900;
Ii.In the alternative to determine that [defendant] must comply with [plaintiff] the financial value of 761 Golden Yek (1) Bahar Azadi estimates estimated at â‚¬ 335.007.42 with the statutory interest on this from the day of the summons until the day of overall paymentof the claim;
III.to determine that [defendant] must perform all necessary acts for valuing and offering the registered property, standing and located at [address] [place 2] with cadastral designation [cadastral designation];
Iv.to determine that [defendant] must perform all necessary acts for the sale and delivery, with the appointment of a notary and a third person who will perform the actions that are necessary for the sale of the aforementioned home instead of [defendant]and make the payment of half of the proceeds from the sale of the property possible to [plaintiff];
V. to order [defendant] to pay the costs of the procedure.
4.2.[plaintiff] is based on its primary claim under I on the basis of the marriage certificate, and after she has renounced part of its claim to the agreed 1361 coins in the divorce proceedings that the parties had in Iran, is still entitledOn a bridal gift of 761 Golden Yek Bahar Azadi Coins.
4.3.
For its claims under III and IV, [plaintiff] relies on the decision of the Court of Appeal of The Hague of 2 October 2019, which stipulates that [defendant] must reimburse half of the capacity accumulated by him during the marriage to [plaintiff].This capacity accrued by [defendant] consists of the surplus value of his home.Because [defendant] states that he cannot work and has no assets, [defendant] must be forced to sell his home and perform all actions that are required for the sale of the home.
4.4.
[defendant] defends.He disputes the bridal gift to owe.Firstly, he argues that he does not have to pay a bridal gift, because, according to him, [plaintiff] did not have the right to submit a divorce request on the basis of the marriage certificate.Secondly, the number of coins stated in the marriage certificate is a symbolic amount.If [defendant] can already be held to pay the bridal gift, he argues that he is unable to do so - in view of his financial situation - he is unable to do so.He is seriously ill, so he can no longer work and receive a WIA benefit.Taking into account the capacity of [defendant], the claim for the release of the bridal gift can at most be granted up to 110 Golden Yek Bahar Azadi coins.
4.5.
Furthermore, [defendant] disputes the basis of the claims that relate to the sale of the property.According to [defendant], [plaintiff] is only entitled to half of the capacity accumulated by him during the marriage.He purchased the house before the marriage, so that [plaintiff] cannot claim this.Moreover, there is no added value of the home, according to [defendant].
4.6.
The statements of the parties are discussed below, insofar as relevant.
5
The assessment
Jurisdiction and applicable law
5.1.
Parties have both Dutch and Iranian nationality.Because [defendant] (just like [plaintiff]) has a place of residence in the Netherlands, that circumstance on the basis of Article 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (RV) does not stand in the way of the jurisdiction of the Dutch court.As follows from the decision of the Court of Appeal The Hague of 2 October 2019
1
the matrimonial property regime of the parties is governed by Iranian law, because the marital conditions of the parties unambiguously result in a choice of law for Iranian law.The parties also assume this for this procedure.
The consequences of the Iranian divorce procedure
5.2.
As discussed at the hearing, it is not in dispute between the parties that these proceedings are not concerned with enforcement of the judgments of the Iranian court in the divorce proceedings that the parties had in Iran.After all, it is certain that the Iranian court only pronounced the divorce between the parties and has not ruled on a claim by [plaintiff] to issue the bridal gift.The parties therefore agree that the judgments of the Iranian court are not important for the present proceedings.
Introduction
5.3.
After this, the court will first assess the primary claim for delivery of 761 Golden Yek Bahar Azadi Coins.Because the court will grant the primary claim, the assessment of the subsidiary claim is not being given.Subsequently, the claims that relate to the sale of the home of [defendant] are discussed.The court will reject those claims.
Yek Bahar Azadi Gold Coins
5.4.
The parties have previously litigated on the bridal gift at the District Court of The Hague and then the Court of Appeal The Hague.In that procedure [plaintiff] 1361 Golden Cins progressed.The Court of Appeal of The Hague ruled by decision of 2 October 2019 that the claim of [plaintiff] was too indefinite, because [plaintiff] had not indicated what the size, weight and value of the coins were to be.The claim has therefore been rejected.The type of coins is no longer in dispute in the present procedure.
5.5.As in this procedure, [defendant], in the proceedings at the Court of Appeal The Hague, argued that the agreement between the parties about the bridal gift only had a symbolic meaning.The Court of Appeal has passed and ruled that the defense has been entitled to the bridal gift.As the Court of Appeal has ruled, the bridal gift must be qualified as a SUI Generis claim and, on the basis of Article 1082 of the Iranian Law of 1935, the wife and owner of the bridal gift from the day of marriage closure.Because [defendant] has not mentioned any new arguments in these proceedings that can be a different opinion [place 1], the court will join the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the decision of 2 October 2019. The court adds to thisThat the text of the marriage certificate in no way shows that the parties have only meant the bridal gift symbolically.The single (non -substantiated) statement of [defendant] that he has never been able to comply with the 1361 Golden Coins in the marriage certificate, partly in the light of the Iranian law on the basis of which the woman (an enforceable) is entitled toThe bridal gift from the marriage closure, in any case insufficient for the conclusion that the bridal gift is only symbolic and not due.
5.6.
The condition for issuing the bridal gift that the woman may not have taken the divorce initiative has judged the court in violation of Dutch public order.In the opinion of the court, the same has to apply to the condition that the woman - unlike the man - may only request divorce on the basis of the reasons mentioned in the marriage certificate.That is why the defense of [defendant] also fails that [plaintiff] is not entitled to the bridal gift because, according to him, she was not allowed to request divorce because the conditions of the marriage certificate have not been met, apart from that the Iranian court's court request for the divorce request of [plaintiff]has honored.
5.7.
[defendant] disputes (in the alternative) the number of Golden Yek Bahar Azadi coins that he owes [plaintiff].For this he refers to the report of the International Legal Institute (IJI) submitted as production 5 in the conclusion of the answer.It follows from this report that on the basis of Iranian law on a claim, insofar as it exceeds 110 Bahar Azadi gold pieces, litters.The man's capacity can be included in the judicial decision on a claim of a bridal gift, insofar as it amounts to more than 110 Bahar Azadi coins.A repayment in installments of the excess above 110 coins is then possible.
5.8.
About his capacity, [defendant] argued that he is seriously ill and only receives a WIA benefit.According to [defendant], these medical circumstances ensure that a real payout arrangement is not possible, because one gold coin per year is already too much for him.
5.9.
[plaintiff] disputes the medical health of [defendant] and argues that in the context of the Iranian procedure, [defendant] has stated that he is wealthy, that he is working and that he is highly educated.Then [defendant] stated that he would take care of all kinds of lessons and congresses.According to [plaintiff], [defendant] is able to work and also has capacity in the form of surplus value of his home.
5.10.
In view of the reasoned dispute by [plaintiff], it was on the road of [defendant] to pay his statement that he is at all able to pay the claim of [plaintiff] above 110 gold coins - not even with a minimum dropout schemeof one gold coin per year - to be further substantiated.The mere circumstance that he receives a WIA benefit is insufficient in the light of the statements of [plaintiff].In addition, [defendant] did not substantiate the (over) value of an owner -occupied home when determining Iranian law in determining the man's capacity in the context of the bridal gift.The report of the IJI reported by him does not show that at least.[Defendant] has therefore not stated sufficiently for the conclusion that a payment in installments must be determined when the claim is awarded for the section above 110 Golden Coins.The claim under I will therefore be granted as advanced.
5.11.
Because the primary claim is granted, the subsidiary claim as included under II does not require a discussion.
Sales property
5.12.[plaintiff] also requests that [defendant] must perform all actions for the valuation, sale and delivery of his home.[plaintiff] states that he is entitled to half the assets that [defendant] obtained during the marriage.According to [plaintiff], it is therefore entitled to reimbursement of half of the added value of the home of [defendant].Because [defendant] has stated that he has no assets and therefore does not have the financial resources to reimburse half of the added value of his home, [defendant] must be obliged to sell his home, according to [plaintiff].
5.13.
The court finds that in these proceedings [plaintiff] does not claim payment of half of the added value of the home of [defendant], but claims that [defendant] is obliged to sell his home and half of the sales proceeds toreimburse her.It is not in dispute between the parties that the house is exclusively owned by [defendant] and that the mortgage loan is only in the name of [defendant].Quite apart from the answer to the question whether the home has added value and whether [plaintiff] can claim reimbursement of half of that, the court is of the opinion with [defendant] that a basis for obliging [defendant] to be able to oblige his homethere is no selling.The claims under III and IV will therefore be rejected.
Proceedings
5.14.
The court sees no reason to deviate from the starting point that the costs of proceedings are compensated between the parties, because the parties have been married to each other.This means that each party bears its own costs.
