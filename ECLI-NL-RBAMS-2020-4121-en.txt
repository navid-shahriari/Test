Course of the procedure
On January 23, 2020, [the applicant] applied a summons with productions that intend to terminate the employment contract, payment of overdue wages, granting a transition payment and fair compensation.By judgment of 28 May 2020, the subdistrict court judge stipulated that the case was brought incorrectly and is continued according to the rules of a petition procedure.
On July 27, 2020, prior to the hearing, Par Hasard made its position known by e-mail.The request was dealt with orally on July 27, 2020. [The applicant] was present with his son, assisted by T. Vinken (office companion of Mr. I.A. Hashem Jawaheri).No one was present on behalf of Par Hasard.After the hearing, the authorized representative of [the applicant] reported by telephone that no solution was reached even after the hearing.
Facts
1. If stated and not (sufficiently) contradicted, the following is certain:
1.1.
Par Hasard is a restaurant and hospitality company.
1.2.
[the applicant] joined Par Hasard on 1 May 2015 in the position of Dishwasher/ Sous Chef.
1.3.
After a labor dispute, [the applicant] reported sick in August 2019 with health problems.
1.4.
The wage during illness is not (fully) paid.On 9 September 2019, [the applicant] summoned Par Hasard in summary proceedings and the wage claimed for the months of July and August 2019.
1.5.
An amount of € 1,682.56 was paid on 30 September 2019, which, according to [the applicant], corresponds to the wage for the month of September.
1.6.
By judgment of 9 October 2019, Par Hasard was convicted of paying the wages for the months of July and August 2019, plus the up to 25% limited legal increase and the statutory interest.
1.7.
Subsequently, on 28 October 2019, Par Hasard paid an amount of € 1,250 to [the applicant].
1.8.
In December 2019/January 2020, the parties spoke about a solution to the Minne, but did not reach an agreement.
Request
2. [applicant] requests the subdistrict court judge, insofar as possible enforceable in stock:
A. to terminate the employment contract;
To order par Hasard
- the overdue wage counted from July 2019 to an amount of € 12,250.00, plus € 1,084.13 holiday allowance, statutory increase (maximized to half of the amount due) and statutory interest on this amount from the day of summonsUntil the day of payment, to be settled with the amount already paid;
- to pay a transition payment of € 2,722.21 plus statutory interest from the day of summons to the day of payment;
- to pay a fair reimbursement of € 6,125.00 plus statutory interest on this amount from the day of summons to the day of payment;
- for reimbursement of extrajudicial collection costs up to a course of € 1,416.95;
- to pay the costs of the proceedings;
3. [the applicant] bases - in essence - on this request that, despite repeated requests, Par Hasard has paid too little wage for months.As a result, [the applicant] has gained financial problems.This while he has the care of a minor child.[the applicant] is unable to pay the rent, which means he threatens to lose his house.[The applicant] also has health problems due to the situation that has arisen.In view of these circumstances, the initiative of the employment contract is not sustainable.[the applicant] is entitled to a transition payment and fair compensation for the serious culpable action by Par Hasard.
Defense4. In the e-mail of 27 July 2020, Par Hasard (Mr. [involved person]) stated that the company was in very difficult weather due to a bankruptcy of the location in Almere.The moment it went better, problems arose by Corona.Due to the financial problems, it is not possible to pay the overdue wage in one go, but to pay it in parts, says Par Hasard.Par Hasard also writes “
We will mr.pay [the applicant] and hope to handle this file today. "
Judgement
5. When assessing the request, the subdistrict court judge will successively discuss the overdue wage, the request for termination of the employment contract, the transition payment, the fair compensation and other items.
Overdue
6. By judgment of 9 October 2019, Par Hasard was convicted of paying the wages for July and August 2019 (see section 1.6), so there is already a title for this.Furthermore, it is not in dispute that the wage was paid for September 2019 (see section 1.5).This means that the right to wage payment for the months of October 2019 to the present must be assessed, with deduction of what has been paid.
7. Based on the laid down lanes submitted (production 3, 6), the regular salary paid out is € 1,671.25 gross per month and the holiday allowance 8.85% of this.In the first two years of illness, an employee retains the right to 70% of the wage, whereby this must be the minimum wage at least in the first year (Article 7: 629 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code).For the employee, this legal provision can be deviated from in favor of the collective labor agreement or individual employment contract.A deviation to the detriment of the employee is only possible for the first two days of illness.At point 7.3 of the individual employment contract (production 3) it was stated that if a new hospitality collective agreement is concluded after 1 April 2014, it will be an integral part of the employment contract.The Horeca CAOs 2018/2019 and 2020 have also been declared generally binding.According to Article 2.2 of the Horeca CAO (both CAO 2018/2019 and 2020), the collective labor agreement has a minimum carater where only in writing
in favor
may be lost from the employee.Pursuant to Article 7.2 of the Horeca CAO (both CAO 2018/2019 and 2020), the sick employee receives if he adheres to the rules during illness,
95%
of the monthly wage during the first 52 weeks of illness.In the following 52 weeks of illness, a supplement of up to 75% of the monthly wage applies.[the applicant] reported sick in August 2019 and is therefore still in the first year of illness (see section 1.3).He is therefore entitled to 95% of his usual salary during the first year of illness.
8. The subdistrict court judge considers that an amount of
€ 16,670.72 gross
To the unpaid wage during illness is notable (€ 1671.25 x 10.5 = € 17,548.13 / 100 = € 175.48 x 95 = € 16,670.72).During the oral hearing, [the applicant] stated that a total of € 3000.00 net has been paid by Par Hasard, which must be deducted from the claim.Par Hasard acknowledges that the wage is not fully paid and has not been a substantive defense with regard to the exact amounts.
9. The non -paid holiday allowance for the period from October 2019 to mid -August 2020 can be assigned up to an amount of
€ 1,475.36 gross
(€ 16,670.72 / 100 = € 166.71 x 8.85 = € 1,475.36).
10. Due to the late payment of the wage and the holiday allowance, the total amount of € 16,670.72 gross and € 1,475.36 gross =
€ 18,146.08
Gross increased by the statutory interest and the legal increase (Article 6: 119 of the Dutch Civil Code, Article 7: 625 of the Dutch Civil Code), on the understanding that the legal increase is limited to (maximum) 25%.Par Hasard has stated undisposed that she is in financially bad weather.This conviction in the overdue wage applies to [the applicant] by Par Hasard under deduction of amounts that have been paid by Par Hasard from October 2019.
Dissolution of the employment contract
11. On the basis of Article 7: 671c paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code, the subdistrict court judge can terminate the employment contract at the request of the employee due to circumstances that are of such a nature that the employment contract should end up immediately or after a short time.
12. In this case, the subdistrict court judge considers a reasonable ground for the request of [the applicant] because, despite repeated requests and a short-proceeding procedure, the wage during illness has not been paid (in full) for a long time.Furthermore, Par Hasard has hardly carried out reintegration activities.The continuation of employment, with the risk of rising problematic debts and the loss of his home, cannot be expected from [the applicant].The subdistrict court judge dissolves the employment contract from
August 17, 2020
.
Transition payment13. In the event of a request from the employee to terminate the employment contract
A condition for granting the transition payment on the basis of Article 7: 673 (1) (b), Secondly, there is serious culpable act or omissions of the employer.
14. It follows from the history of the law that seriously culpable acts or omissions of an employer will only occur in exceptional cases, for example if an employer grurly fails to fulfill the obligations arising from the employment contract and as a result a disturbed employment relationship arises (see:
Parliamentary papers II,
2013-2014, 33 818, no. 3, p.34).The subdistrict court judge is considering that the most important obligation of an employer is to fully and timely pay the regular monthly wage.[The applicant] has not been paid his entire wage during illness for months, despite various requests for this and legal proceedings.[the applicant] has argued that he has come into serious financial problems and that this has harmed his health due to long-term stress and voltage complaints.In addition, Par Hasard has not or hardly carried out reintegration efforts.These circumstances mean that there are serious culpable acts on the side of Par Hasard and therefore a transition payment is granted.
15. When determining the amount of the transition payment, the date is based on the date of 1 May 2015, date from service 17 August 2020 and a gross monthly income € 1671.00 (completed).This has a duration of more than five years.The reimbursement is roughly 1/3rd monthly salary per year of service, the amount calculated by [the applicant] of
€ 2,722.21
The subdistrict court judge is reasonable and is assignable.
Fair compensation
16. A fair compensation may, on the basis of Article 7: 671c paragraph 2 under b of the Dutch Civil Code, if the dissolution is the result of serious culpable acts or omissions of the employer.For this it has been considered that this is the case, for this reason the fair compensation will be allocated.
17. The subdistrict court judge is considering the following about the amount of the fair compensation.The fair compensation must - by its nature - be related to the seriously culpable act or omissions of the employer.When determining the size of the fair compensation, it will be further on assessing all circumstances of the case (see: HR 30 June 2017, ECLI: NL: HR: 2017: 1187, New Hairstyle).The consequences of the dismissal can also be taken into account, insofar as those consequences can be attributed to the reproach that the employer can be made.When determining the fair compensation, it is ultimately about the employee being compensated for the seriously culpable acting or omissions of the employer, but the fair compensation has no specific punitive character.When determining the fair compensation, the subdistrict court judge must motivate the value of the employment contract, the length of the employment is important here (see: HR 29 May 2020, ECLI: NL: HR: 2020: 955).
18. The subdistrict court judge considers the following circumstances relevant in this context.The employment has been of limited expensive, namely five years.Par Hasard has stated that there is poor financial circumstances.Par Hasard has not substantiated that in any way.Furthermore, it is important that [the applicant] has a difficult labor market position in view of his illness and age.Also, Par Hasard has not or hardly carried out reintegration efforts and, despite various requests and a conviction in summary proceedings, the wage for a long time did not pay.During the oral hearing, the authorized representative of [the applicant] stated that for the budget of the fair compensation, the loss of income for the second year of illness was assumed, in which [the applicant] probably cannot work and falls back on a payment that is lower than thewages he earned.In view of the aforementioned factors and in view of the fact, the subdistrict court judge considers that no defense was laid on this point, the requested amount of
€ 6,125.00
Gross a fair compensation that is appropriate in the present situation.
Other
19. [the applicant] requested a conviction for payment of an amount of extrajudicial collection costs of € 1,416.95.Since Par Hasard did not respond to this, this is assigned as insufficiently.However, the amount to be allocated in accordance with the calculation according to the Staffel collection costs will be limited to
€ 1,080.30
.
20. Par Hasard is charged with the costs of the proceedings as the unsuccessful party.
