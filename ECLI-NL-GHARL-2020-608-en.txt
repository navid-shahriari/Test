The course of the appeal proceedings
1.1
For the course of the proceedings until 8 October 2019, the Court of Appeal refers to its interim decision of that date.
1.2
The further course is evident from:
-
a journal report of 17 October 2019 from Jawaheri with a deed statement;
-
A deed statement by mr. Stampink, received on October 21, 2019.
2
The reasons for the decision
2.1
The Court of Appeal remains with what has been considered and decides in the interim decision of 8 October 2019, insofar as it is not considered or decided otherwise below.
2.2
In that decision, the Court of Appeal held the case to give the parties the opportunity to be in writing of the intended decision of the Court with regard to the conditional incidental appeal of the woman and to indicate whether it is, in the event that theCourt returns from his decision that the woman has not lodged an incidental appeal, wish oral treatment, or prefer a written settlement by the Court.In the latter case, the parties must indicate whether they wish a further written round wish, or whether the Court can take the case on the documents present.The parties commented on this for the reports mentioned above under 1.2.
2.3
With reference to legal considerations 5.4 and 5.5 of the interim decision of this Court of 8 October 2019, the Court, contrary to the man, is of the opinion that there is a conditional incidental appeal of the woman.
The Court of Appeal deduces this from the way in which the petitum under II of the defense is formulated in the principal appeal.The Court of Appeal reads the petitum under II thus that if the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that Iranian law applies to the matrimonial property regime, the woman incidentally loses an appeal.The substantiation of that incidental appeal deduces the Court from point 1.11 to 1.20 of the defense in the principal appeal.It follows that the man's defense stating that no incidental appeal has been lodged.
The Court of Appeal finds that none of the parties in his or her statement has requested an oral treatment or a second written round.That is why the Court will now further dismiss the case on the documents.
2.4
In her incidental appeal, the woman requests the man to pay € 31,350 to the woman, plus the statutory interest from two weeks after serving the decision to be given and to order him to share his assets in equal halvesWith the woman.Furthermore, the woman requests the man to condemn the costs of the woman's costs.The woman bases her incidental request on the provisions agreed between the parties in the marriage contract.
2.5
In his appeal, with regard to the bridal gift, the man requests that he is in line with the ruling of this Court of 24 December 2013. The Court of Appeal ruled that the bridal gift under Iranian law does not fall under partner alimony and also not under matrimonial property law, but a legal figuresui generis is.According to the man, the woman has submitted the divorce request, while the bridal gift is partly intended to prevent the man from separating.Now that not the man but the woman has submitted the divorce request, the bridal gift cannot arrive at the woman, the court understands the man.Furthermore, the man states that the woman has never behaved as a good wife in the sense of Iranian law, so that she is not entitled to the bridal gift for that reason either.
2.6The court considers as follows.During the oral hearing at the Court on 4 July 2019, both parties stated that the marriage contract was signed by both parties.The Court of Appeal finds that the following is included in the sworn in sworn German translation of the marriage contract ("HeiraSurkundekunde") at the heading "Brautgeld" (see production J at the petition on appeal of the man):
“Ein Band Koran, Ein Spiegel, U.Ein a few kerzenträger, who sie auf Erklärung Schon Erhalten Hat, Einschl.110 Einbahar-e-Azadi-Goldmünzen Die Restlos Zu Lasten des Ehhemanns Gehen, Jedoch Auf Forederung der Ehefrau Ihr Auszuzahlen sind. ”
2.7
The Court of Appeal concludes from the text of this clause that, without further conditions being set to it, the man must pay the bridal gift to her at the first request of the woman.Furthermore, the text of the clause does not show that submitting the divorce request in the way of claiming the bridal gift.In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, it is not apparent from the marriage contract that for the repayment obligation of the man of the wedding to the woman, it is doing whether or not the woman has behaved as a good wife.The man has the statement of the woman that the bridal gift is due and payable at any time and not only after the arrangement of certain conditions, not even disputed.In view of this, the Court will ignore what the man has submitted to his notice of appeal with regard to the bridal gift.
Furthermore, the Court of Appeal notes that the man has not contradicted the value of the wedding of € 31,350.Nor has the man disputed the liability of the statutory interest.
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the above, the incidental request on appeal of the woman to this section is prone to allocation.
2.8
With regard to the incidental request on appeal of the woman to condemn the man to share his assets in equal halves with women, the Court considers as follows.Apart from the views of the parties, the Court of Appeal will reject this request from the woman now that it is insufficiently determined.The woman bases her request on the marriage certificate, but has not stated what the size and value of the man's components to be distributed in her opinion are.The mere, the undated list of assets, without mentioning the moment of acquisition and the value of the goods in the context of her request for distribution of the Community of Goods it sets by it)insufficient for this.

The conclusion
In the principal appeal
3.1
The complaint succeeds on the basis of what has been considered above.The Court of Appeal will destroy and decide the contested decision, insofar as it is subject to its judgment.
In the incidental appeal
3.2
On the basis of what has been considered above, the woman's request is partly susceptible to allocation.The Court of Appeal will annul the contested decision, insofar as it is subject to its judgment, and decide as follows.
3.3
The Court of Appeal will compensate the costs of the proceedings on appeal, now that the parties are (former) spouses and the procedure concerns the consequences of the divorce.

The decision
The Court of Appeal, having in the principal and the incidental appeal:

December 13, 2018, insofar as the Court of Appeal was subject to the opinion of the Court, and to the extent that again:
declares for the right that Iranian law applies to the matrimonial property regime of the parties;
orders the man to pay the woman of the amount of € 31,350, plus the statutory interest from fourteen days after the date of service of this decision,
declares this conviction for payment enforceable in stock;
