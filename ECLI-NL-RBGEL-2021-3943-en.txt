The facts
2.1.
The parties have concluded an agreement for contracting work with regard to the home of [plaintiff in the Convention/defendant in the counterclaim].[defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] has taken on to perform work on the home of [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim].These activities include in any case the work as included in the signed quotation of 11 March 2019, for example stucco, sealing walls or larger and making electricity work.The signed quotation of 11 March 2019 states a contract sum of € 37,310.00, including VAT for € 20,000.00.
2.2.
There are various other quotations and invoices from [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] in the file, including:
A quotation with dates 11 March 2019 (typed) and 12 March 2019 (with pen credited), for a total amount of € 52,610.00 excluding VAT

and invoice of 26 July 2019 for an amount of € 15,548.59.
2.3.
[defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim] started work on or shortly after 23 April 2019.
2.4.
On August 5, 2019, the Eigen Huis Association carried out a delivery inspection.This inspection was discontinued because a discussion arose between the sister of [plaintiff in Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim], who was present on behalf of [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim], and [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim].The report of that inspection states insofar as relevant:
“"
In the overview below, the defects found by the architect and any comments were posted.
(...)
1 bedroom (front) floor (in corner to the left next to the interior door) cement screed;as a protesting point included by Bouwer.2 bedroom (front) inner frame door;free size under the door insufficient;as a protesting point included by Bouwer.3;delivery stopped
.(...)
After barely started in the bedroom at the front on the 2nd floor, a very fierce argument (partly in foreign language) arose between contractor and client.The contractor then ran away angry.The contractor below indicated that almost everything was done for free, after which the fight between the parties went on.The inspection has therefore been immediately discontinued
. "
2.5.
Also on 5 August 2019, [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in Restonvention] sent an e-mail to [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant] with the following content:
“"

(...)

We have to stop the work here.
I give you 7 days to deposit the full amount of your outstanding balance including VAT in our account, so that we can compile another plan
.(...) ”.
2.6.
Subsequently, on 9 August 2019, the lawyer of [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in counterclaim] sent a letter to [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim].It states, as far as relevant, the following:
“"
The client has shown that you (i) have not carried out certain activities as stated on the invoice, but did not charge it and (ii) did not perform certain activities properly
(...).
X.In view of the above request, I will inform you within 5 working days (i) client whether you are willing to restore the inadequate work - without additional costs - and (ii) client inquire within which period you will perform this work.

Then I will soon be legal proceedings for whose - considerable - costs are for your account.
"
.
2.7.
The lawyer of [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the Ralmination] responded to the above by e-mails of 12 August 2019 and 18 August 2019.In these e-mails, [defendant in Convention/claimant in the counterclaim] indicates that [plaintiff in the proceedings/defendant in the counterclaim] wrongly did not pay (additional work) invoices that [defendant in the convention/claimant in the counterclaim] was as a result thereofhas stopped activities and that the property has not yet been delivered.
2.8.
[plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] had a architectural inspection report drawn up by Keuringshuis B.V.In this report of 23 August 2019, Keuringshuis B.V.Various measures that still have to be taken before the home can be inhabited.
2.9.
[Defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in Raliating] sent an e-mail with two invoices to [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] on 26 August 2019.The e-mail says: “
I will send you two outstanding invoices.This time is the last reminder.We request the outstanding amount within 5 working days in the name of [name of the defendant]
[Court: [Defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in Rigence]]
to transfer to account
(...) ”
The first invoice was dated 11 March 2019 (the invoice referred to under 2.2. D.) relates to the work as included on the signed quotation of 11 March 2019. This is an invoice for a total amount of € 45,145.10.It says:

2.10.
By e-mail of 5 September 2019, the lawyer of [defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in Restonvision] reported the following to [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the countertop]:
“(...)
Client, [name of company Defendant], is of the opinion that Mr [plaintiff in Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] still owes him EUR 22,696.60 on the basis of the agreement concluded between the parties to adopt work.To this end, the Client has also sent a reminder to Mr [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] The payment term of which has since been more than exceeded, without any payment having taken place.
That is why Mr [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] is given the opportunity to pay the outstanding invoice of the client by the client by the last time and at the latest on Monday 9 September at the latest on Monday 9 September a.s.The aforementioned amount to the client's bank account number known to him.If the Lord [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] do not comply with this, then the client will take further legal action.
For the sake of completeness, it is noted that the client is still willing to complete his work with Mr [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] at home and to deliver the condition in the agreed condition.Insofar as [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] refuses his cooperation in this regard, he is therefore in credit server ventilation.
(...) ”.
2.11.

will declare that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] has been culpably failed in the implementation of the Agreement and will terminate the agreement because of this attributable shortcoming,
will declare that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] (therefore) is liable for the damage that [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] as a result, as a result,
[defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in Ralmacy] will order compensation for the damage to [plaintiff in Convention/defendant in the counterclaim], primarily on the basis of a claim budget to be drawn up and in the case of referral to the claim status procedure [defendant in convention/plaintiff in counterclaim] will condemn the contract sum of € 37,310.00,

3.2.
[Defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the Ralmination] is defending.
3.3.
The statements of the parties are discussed below, insofar as relevant.
in counterclaim
3.4.
[defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] claims that the court is enforceable in stock by judgment:
It will declare that [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has committed non -performance in the fulfillment of his obligation against [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim] by not paying the additional work on the one hand and [defendant in the convention/on the other handplaintiff in the counterclaim] not the opportunity to perform repair work to be performed
[plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] will order payment of the bill for the additional work, plus the statutory interest on this from the date on which that amount had become due and payable
[plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] will order the costs of the proceedings and the subsequent costs, plus the statutory interest from 14 days after the judgment to be considered.
3.5.
[plaintiff in the convention/defendant in counterclaim] is defending.
3.6.
The statements of the parties are discussed below, insofar as relevant.

The assessment
in the convention
4.1.
In this case it is about whether [plaintiff in the proceedings/defendant in the counterclaim] is entitled to compensation due to a shortcoming in the compliance with the agreement/claimant in the counterclaim in the fulfillment of the agreement, or because of unlawful action by [[[Defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the Raliating].In accordance with Article 150 of the Code of Civil Procedure (hereinafter: RV), the obligation to pay and proof with regard to the shortcoming are with regard to the shortcoming (hereinafter: RV) in the Convention/defendant in the counterclaim], since he claims compensation.
4.2.
[plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] states that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] was failed at various points.The court will discuss these points separately.For the answer to the question of whether there is a shortcoming in the fulfillment of the agreement, it is important or the point for which complaining is part of the agreement.
Facade wall
4.3.
[plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] first of all states that the façade wall has not been carried out professionally.In the quotation signed by both parties of 11 March 2019, the court does not see the façade wall again.[Defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in Raliating] also did not invoice the façade wall.The court therefore comes to the conclusion that the façade wall does not belong to the work agreed between the parties.With regard to the façade wall, therefore, there cannot be a shortcoming in the fulfillment of the agreement.
Bead
4.4.[plaintiff in Convention/defendant in the counterclaim] then points to the roof edge, [defendant in the Convention/claimant in the counterclaim] did not perform any work on the roof edge while this has been agreed.The replacement of the roof edge and associated paintwork is stated under point 9 of the quotation of 11 March 2019 and this is therefore part of the agreed work.[Defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the Ralfection] did not perform this work.In this way he was in principle failed to fulfill the agreement and must compensate the damage suffered as a result of the shortcoming.Exceptions exist if the conditions of paragraph 2 of Article 6:74 of the Dutch Civil Code are not met, if the shortcoming cannot be attributed to the debtor, so that there is force majeure (Article 6:75 of the Dutch Civil Code), or if there isCreditors' absenteeism (Section 6:58 of the Dutch Civil Code and Article 6:59 of the Dutch Civil Code) and/or suspension (Section 6:52 and Section 6: 262 of the Dutch Civil Code).[defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] invokes suspension and also argues that [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has achieved that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] has not been able to complete the contracting work.In this context, he argues, among other things, that the intention was to carry out the work on the roof edge on July 29, 2019, but that he did not do this because [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in counterclaim] indicated on that day that heNo more money to pay and because [plaintiff in the proceedings/defendant in the counterclaim] had not ensured that the meter cupboard had already been prepared by a third party.The court will deal with these defenses of [defendant in the proceedings/claimant in the counterclaim] after having dealt with shortcoming set by [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim].
Frame
4.5.
The next shortcoming set relates to the frame.At the hearing it turned out that the parties agree that the frame was placed by someone other than [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim].Work with regard to the frame is also not included in the quotation of 11 March 2019. The court concludes that the frame was not part of the work agreed between the parties.With regard to the frame, therefore, there is no shortcoming in the fulfillment of the agreement.
Staircase
4.6.
[plaintiff in the convention/defendant in counterclaim] also complained about the stairs.According to the signed quotation of 11 March 2019, the stairs had to be moved.However, the stairs have not been moved.Instead, [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the Raliats] bought a new staircase, which [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in Ralmacy] subsequently placed.The Sijmens report shows that the sizes of this staircase do not comply with the Building Decree.The report states about this: “
Existing stairs do not meet the Building Decree.Free width stairwell and stairs is too narrow and the last rise is 290 mm.
".The stairs are also placed on a hatch to the crawl space.[Defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in Raliating] has not reflected these findings of Sijmens with reasons.[Defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] only argues that this is not a building inspection report of an expert, but a cost task.That is why the court assumes that the staircase does not comply with the Building Decree.
4.7.
The question is whether this yields a breach of contract by [defendant in the proceedings/plaintiff in the counterclaim].The court considers about this as follows.Apparently, after signing the quotation of 11 March 2019, parties agreed that a new staircase would be placed instead of moving the old staircase.The Sijmens report shows that the dimensions of the stairs are not suitable for the home.The staircase was ordered by [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in counterclaim].Article 7: 760 paragraph 2 of the Dutch Civil CodeEpeals that if an inadequate implementation is due to defects or unsuitability of cases from the client, the consequences thereof will in principle be for his account.An exception is an exception if the contractor has violated the warning obligation of Article 7: 754 of the Dutch Civil Code.Now that the inadequate version is due to the staircase ordered by [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim], this is in principle for his account.However, [plaintiff in Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] states that [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim] is the expert and that it does not appear that [defendant in the proceedings/claimant in the counterclaim] has communicated with [plaintiff in the proceedings/defendant in the counterclaim]About the sizes of the stairs and the fact that the stairs would be placed on a hatch.The [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] also states that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] indicated which size Trap [plaintiff in the Convention/defendant in counterclaim] had to order.The court sees this as an appeal to violation of the warning obligation of Article 7: 754 of the Dutch Civil Code.She is considering that as follows.
4.8.
[defendant in Convention/claimant in the counterclaim] denies that [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has purchased the stairs on behalf of and on instructions from [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant].According to [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim], [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] purchased the new stairwell without consultation.[defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] disputes that he has passed on measurements.That the stairs would be placed on the hatch of the crawl space, [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] reported in advance to [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim].[plaintiff in the proceedings/defendant in the counterclaim] agreed because the crawl space could also be reached via another Liège, according to [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim].From the fact that [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim], as he himself argues, has not passed on measures to [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim], the court concludes that he does not in the proceedings/defendant in the counterclaim]Has warned that the dimensions of the stairs are not suitable for the home of [plaintiff in Convention/defendant in the counterclaim], while [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] was held on the basis of the obligation to warn.This means that the incorrect dimensions and as a result thereof inadequate placement of the stairs can be attributed to [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim].Insofar as [defendant in the proceedings/claimant in the counterclaim] did not know that the dimensions were unsuitable, this is for his risk.It follows from Article 7: 760 paragraph 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and Article 7: 754 of the Dutch Civil Code that the contractor has the obligation to ascertain the quality of the client's things prior to the execution of the work.It therefore lies on the contractor's way to ensure that this can be properly carried out under the given circumstances before the start of a work.The court concludes from the case law of the Supreme Court that only in exceptional cases, in which there is, for example, expertise of the client and familiarity with defects, an exception to the warning obligation can be assumed (cf. Supreme Court 8 October 2004,ECLI: NL: HR: 2004: AP0954, r.o. 3.3 and Court of Overijssel 15 January 2020, ECLI: NL: RBOVE: 2020: 519).This is not the case here.
4.9.
The conclusion in this section is that [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim was made inadequate with regard to the stairs].
Chimney
4.10.
With regard to the lack of the chimney, [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in counterclaim] refers to the report of the Inspection House (see above 2.8.).That report states on the chimney: “
It should be noted that the connection is not professionally connected
. "[plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has stated undisposed that the chimney connection fell under the quotation, so that it can be assumed.On the basis of the foregoing, the court concludes that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] has not made the chimney connection professionally.
Sanitation
4.11.[plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] blames [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] that he has not carried out a large part of the work with regard to the sanitary facilities.It concerns the work mentioned on page 22 of the report of the inspection house, including sanitary and tile work.[defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] acknowledges that these work has been agreed in the signed quotation of 11 March 2019 and that he did not fully implement it.[defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] does not consistently declare which work he did not perform.In his deed of 23 November 2020, [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in counterclaim] states that on 5 August 2019 he had not yet done the tile work and had not yet placed a glass shower enclosure and toilet pot.In his deed of 22 February 2021, [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim] indicates that the tiling had not yet happened, but that a toilet bot had been placed.However, it is not relevant for the assessment of which activities were not carried out for the assessment.The point is that it is certain that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] did not perform part of the agreed work.This results in a shortcoming, unless the defenses to be discussed later in the Convention/Plaintiff in Raliating] succeed.
4.12.
The work that [defendant did in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim] have been carried out inadequate according to [plaintiff in convention/defendant in the counterclaim], in the sense that [defendant in the proceedings/claimant in counterclaim] failed to ground the bathroom andto kitten.To substantiate this, [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in counterclaim] again points to the report of the Inspection House, the report of Sijmens and the safety inspection report.The defense of [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] that the sealing only happens when tiling has been tiled, so that it does not remove no shortage.With regard to earthen, [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim] argues that he used an earth network, so that no central earth point is needed anymore.This defense does not apply.It follows from the safety inspection report that the lack of a central earth point causes a defect.This report was prepared by an expert.The court therefore assumes the accuracy of the report.
Electricity
4.13.
It follows from the report of the Inspection House that the electricity in the home is inadequate.At the hearing, [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] acknowledged that the electricity was his responsibility.This means there is a shortcoming with regard to the electricity.The fact that [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim] is not given the opportunity to submit a counter-expertise does not change that.The Inspection House is an independent expert who has drawn up the report based on its own observation.She was also able to assess on the basis of her own observation that there is, for example, loose wiring, which is not fire -safe.
Floor, heating and pipework
4.14.
[plaintiff in the convention/defendant in counterclaim] has a number of complaints about the floor, heating and pipework.The first complaint is that the floor is not leveled correctly.In addition, [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] refers to the report of the inspection house stating that the floor is partly leveled.This is insufficient to conclude that the floor is poor.The report of the inspection house says “
The floor is partly leveled.It is advised to see the floor and to level it where necessary
. "The inspection house has labeled the equalization of the floor as "reasonable".A defect is not apparent from the foregoing.This does not cause the court to ask whether the leveling of the floor was part of the assignment, which [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] disputes.
4.15.
In addition, the underfloor heating and the pipework is the subject of dispute.
The position of [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] means that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] would carry out all heating work with the exception of purchasing the radiators.[defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] wrongly did not figure out whether the concrete could be milled.Instead, [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] ““
literally laid the pipes in the floor and bumped into concrete"Said [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim].Part of the pipes is not connected.According to [plaintiff in the proceedings/defendant in the counterclaim], [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] placed him for the accomplished fact that he had laid underfloor heating instead of preparing the pipework for connecting the radiators.[plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] also takes the position that the underfloor heating is so amateurish that the floor heating can only be switched on for the entire home at the same time and not per floor, so that [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in counterclaim] significantcosts for gas and electricity.
4.16.
[defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] disputes the position of [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] and argues that the milling of the concrete, if possible, had certainly been preferred.So he did not choose the easy way.In addition, Timmermans Infra had to complete work before [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in Restonvention] was able to complete work on the meter cupboard, gas, water and electrical lines.[defendant in Convention/claimant in the counterclaim] also refers to the quotation of 11 March 2019 which states that the floor heating would only be realized on the ground floor.Later, according to [defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim], two floors were added at the request of [plaintiff in the Convention/defendant in the counterclaim].[defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] points out that it is not logical that the underfloor heating is laid on all three floors without the client agreeing.[defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] disputes that the floor heating can only be switched on on all floors at the same time.[defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in counterclaim] argues that he has placed a separate distributor and thermostat on each floor, so that [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] can even choose whether he wants to turn on or off the floor heating.
4.17.
The court judges as follows.In accordance with Article 150 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure with regard to the shortcoming with regard to the shortcoming, the duty and proof of proof are with [plaintiff in the proceedings/defendant in counterclaim].Partly in view of the defense of [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim], [plaintiff in Convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has insufficiently substantiated his statements.In view of the defense of [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the Relatus], it cannot be established that the underfloor heating can only be switched on on all floors at the same time, apart from the question of whether that causes a defect.It is also not possible to establish on the basis of the above that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the Raliating] has made an error with regard to the construction of the pipes.Moreover, this also does not follow from the report of the inspection house, which says: “
It cannot be excluded whether the pipework is properly connected and leakage is freely connected.It is advised to appoint a recognized plumber to have the entire installation checked
possible
defects.
If there are defects
to restore this
. "(underlining by the court).
4.18.
The conclusion in this section is that a shortcoming in the fulfillment of the agreement has not been established with regard to the floor, heating and pipework.
Foundation at front door
4.19.
[Plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] also addresses [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in counterclaim] on the interrupting of the foundation on the spot of the front door.A piece of foundation has been removed to bring pipes in, so that the front door frame and the brickwork are now simply on garden soil, according to [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in counterclaim].At the hearing it turned out that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] moved the front door forward, in a place where there was only land and not a foundation.This in principle has failed to fail to fulfill his commitment from the contracting agreement in the contest in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim.
Term for key
4.20.Finally, [plaintiff in Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] based the breach of contract on the basis that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] did not deliver the property in a key ready within six weeks.[Defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the Raliating] disputes the existence of this agreement.To substantiate that agreement, [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in counterclaim] refers to WhatsApp messages between him and [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim].However, those WhatsApp messages only show that the period in which the work would be completed.That a fatal period of six weeks has been agreed is not evident from the file.There is therefore no non -performance of [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] consisting of exceeding a fatal delivery period.
Interlocutory
4.21.
In the foregoing, the court came to the conclusion that the following aspects of the contracting agreement were not or has been implemented inadequately:
a. roof edge: replaced roof edge and associated paintwork is not carried out (see 4.4);
b.stairs: the sizes of the stairs are not suitable for this house (see 4.6-4.9);
c.chimney connection: not professionally connected (see 4.10);
d.Sanitair: work partly not carried out, no central earth point (see 4.11-4.12);
e.electricity: defective (see 4.13);

However, [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim] has submitted a number of general defenses, at least not defends against a specific part of the agreement that [plaintiff has complained in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim].The defenses relate to suspension and the fact that [plaintiff in the proceedings/defendant in the counterclaim] would have argued that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] could not complete or repair the work.If one of these defenses succeeds, there is no default because in that case the requirements of Article 6:74 of the Dutch Civil Code are not met.
Suspension
4.22.
In his e-mail of August 18, 2019, the lawyer of [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in Raliating] writes: “
After all, the agreement that applied and still applies between the parties was that [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] would pay all invoices of [name of the defendant] before [the defendant's name name] would deliver the home ready for key.However, [plaintiff in Convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has notified [name of company Defendant] at some point that he is unable to pay the remaining amount, after which [name of the defendant] has stopped his duties
(...)
[name of the defendant] will therefore not proceed to complete the work
(...)
As long as [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has not paid his payment obligation towards [name of the defendant]
".The defense of [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] As shown above, comes down to an appeal for suspension.After all, the lawyer of [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim] writes that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] at a given moment has stopped pending payment by [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim].
4.23.
For a successful appeal for suspension, a claimable claim against the other party is required (Article 6:52 of the Dutch Civil Code. Article 6: 262 of the Dutch Civil Code).The parties agree that [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has paid the amount of the signed quotation of 11 March 2019.With regard to the originally agreed work, [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] therefore had no claimable claim against [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in counterclaim].The question is whether [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] at the time of suspending another claimable claim against [plaintiff in the Convention/defendant in counterclaim] who could justify the suspension.The moment of suspension is the moment at which [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the Council for the Council] has discontinued the work to which his lawyer refers in the e-mail shown above.That is August 5, 2019, see the under 2.5.The e-mail shown in which [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff writes in the counterclaim]: “
We must stop here from the work
".On August 5, 2019, the payment term of the under 2.9 was.Invoices referred to.This means there is a claimable claim.
4.24.Pursuant to Article 6:52 of the Dutch Civil Code, between that claim and the commitment of [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim], there must be sufficient coherence to justify the suspension.When answering the question of whether there is sufficient coherence, both the relationship between the mutual obligations (convexity) and the size of the suspension (proportionality) are important.With regard to the Connexity, in this case it applies that both commitments arise from the same legal relationship (Section 6:52 (2) of the Dutch Civil Code).This means that, given that degree of coherence, it must be considered whether this suspension is justified on the basis of all circumstances of the case.To this end, the court considers as follows.The outstanding amount that [plaintiff did not pay in the proceedings/defendant in the counterclaim] is € 22,693.60 (€ 15,548.50 + € 7,145.10, see r.o. 2.9.).However, [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in counterclaim] has disputed the accuracy of these invoices.The debate about those invoices is therefore still open so that the size of the claim is not clear at the moment.In addition, the court has established in the foregoing that there are a number of defects (4.21.).A commitment may arise from [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in Raliating] for repair or compensation.Whether that is the case and its size is also not clear at the moment.As a result, the court cannot now assess whether the work that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the Council for Nations] is in proportion to the outstanding invoices.This is at the risk of [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the Ralmacy] because he invokes suspension.In addition, the invoices mentioned under 2.9 exceed.The original budget was more than in height and had a short payment term of only five days, which had not been exceeded for long.The court is of the opinion that in view of all circumstances of the case as outlined above, in particular the short payment term of five days that had only expired for a few days, the appeal to suspension in this case is unacceptable in this case.This leads to the conclusion that the appeal for suspension does not succeed.
The defense that [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] achieved that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] could not complete the contracting work and -as far as necessary -perform repair work.
4.25.
[defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] invokes that [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] has prevented a proper completion of the work by [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim].To this end, [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim] argues that the intention was to carry out the work on the roof edge on July 29, 2019, but that he did not do this because [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] is not thereBefore ensured that the meter cupboard had already been prepared by a third party.However, it is not clear to the court how that does not perform the work on the roof edge justifies.It had been on the road of [defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] to further substantiate this.He didn't do that.Furthermore, [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] argues that he has not been given the opportunity to carry out repair work and not to complete the work.After all, [plaintiff in Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] no longer wanted to give the defendant/plaintiff in the counterclaim] to the home.On the other hand, [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] argues that [defendant in the proceedings/claimant in the counterclaim] does not have the required expertise to perform the repair work.The court is considering this as follows.Article 7: 759 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code does not apply because this ARTIKEL sees defects that are available after delivery.Insofar as fulfillment is not permanently impossible, Article 6:74 (2) of the Dutch Civil Code stipulates that default on the part of [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] is necessary before there is non -performance.There was no question of this.The following is decisive.Article 6:82 of the Dutch Civil Code stipulates that the default occurs when the debtor is given a default in the event of a written reminder, in which a reasonable period of fulfillment is set to him, and fulfillment is not made within this period.[plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] formally addressed [defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] by letter of 9 August 2019 (see 2.6.).Subsequently, on 5 September 2019, [defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] announced that he was willing to complete the work at [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] and to deliver in the agreed condition (see 2.10).[plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim] states that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] has indicated that he is not willing to complete the work at the agreed price and concludes from that statement that [defendant in the convention/claimant in the counterclaim] his obligations would not fulfill.This defense does not succeed because the relevant communication by [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] had already been made, namely on August 5 (see 2.5., “
We must stop here from the work
").[defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in the counterclaim] was also not in default because of the exceedance of a building period of six weeks (4.20.) The foregoing means that the letter of 9 August 2019 is not sufficient for the default on the part of [[let the defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim].[plaintiff in the proceedings/defendant in counterclaim] should have given [defendant in the counterclaim/claimant in counterclaim] the opportunity to perform repair work for the delivery and to complete the work so that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the countertop]could fulfill.The in 4.21.After all, established defective fulfillment was still repairable.In view of the foregoing, there is no non -performance (Article 6:74 paragraph 2).The court will therefore reject the claims on this point.
Unlawful act
4.26.
[plaintiff in Convention/defendant in the counterclaim] also claims a statement that there is unlawful act (Article 6: 162 of the Dutch Civil Code) by [defendant in the convention/claimant in counterclaim].With regard to the standard forces required for Article 6: 162 of the Dutch Civil Code, [plaintiff in Convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has argued that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] did not comply with regulations that may be assumed as known in the construction industry.It does not make it clear which regulations that are in the counterclaim/defendant in the counterclaim], except that he states that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] has not placed a lead slab on the frames in violation of the regulations.However, in the foregoing, the court ruled that the frames were not the responsibility of [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim], so that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] could not have acted contrary to the regulations in this context.[plaintiff in the proceedings/defendant in the counterclaim] also argues that it has been established in an independent inspection that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] acted in violation of regulations.He does not make it clear which inspection [plaintiff in convention/defendant] does not mean.[plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has therefore insufficiently substantiated his statement.In addition, the court ruled in the foregoing that there is no non -performance.[plaintiff in the proceedings/defendant in the counterclaim] has not sufficiently stated that the opinion that [defendant in the proceedings/claimant in the counterclaim] has acted unlawfully towards him.In view of the foregoing, the court will reject the declaration of right that there is unlawful act.
Dissolution
4.27.[plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] further claims that the court terminates the agreement existing between the parties.Pursuant to Article 7: 756 (1) of the Dutch Civil Code, the court can terminate the contracting agreement on the claim of the client for delivery.[defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] states that he never delivered the work.As long as the contractor does not indicate that the work is ready to be delivered, there is no delivery (Article 7: 758 of the Dutch Civil Code).For dissolution on the basis of Article 7: 756 of the Dutch Civil Code, it is not required that fulfillment will be impossible without shortcoming.It is sufficient that before the set time of delivery it will probably not be delivered on time or not properly.In the opinion of the court, this condition has been met, since a lot of time has already passed since [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] has last carried out work at [plaintiff in Convention/defendant in the counterclaim].The court will therefore allocate this claim of [plaintiff in the Convention/Defendant in the counterclaim].The court determines the consequences of the dissolution (Article 7: 756 paragraph 3 of the Dutch Civil Code).The court does this as follows.Due to the dissolution, the commitments arising from the contracting agreement are terminated.The court sees no reason for a (back) payment obligation or a un With a unpowering commitment.The activities of the original quotation (of 11 March 2019) were largely carried out.This was also paid since [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has paid € 38,000.00.The work on the bathroom has not been carried out in its entirety, but on the other hand, [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] also carried out work that is not in the original quotation.It is certain, for example, that [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] has laid underfloor heating on all floors instead of just on the ground floor.In addition, some activities have been carried out inadequately, but this is not due to [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in counterclaim] since he has not been given the opportunity to restore this before delivery.The court cannot budget the precise consequences of the dissolution.The court therefore stipulates that the parties have nothing to claim from each other as a result of the dissolution on the basis of the contracting agreement.
Reimbursement of paid amounts
4.28.
Claim 5 of [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] aims to repay the amounts paid to [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim].A legal basis is missing from this claim.There is no question of undue payment.[plaintiff in Convention/defendant in the counterclaim] made the payments to [defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] on the basis of the contracting agreement and [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] also carried out work on this.This claim must therefore be rejected.
Penalty
4.29.
The claim for payment of a penalty (claim 6 of [plaintiff in the Convention/defendant in counterclaim]) is not assignable because Article 611a, paragraph 1, of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a penalty cannot be imposed in the event of a conviction for payment of a sum of money.Moreover, the claims to which [plaintiff in the Convention/defendant in the counterclaim] connects the penalty will be rejected.
in counterclaim
4.30.
The statement claimed in the counterclaim that [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has committed non -performance by not giving [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] the opportunity to perform repair work is not assignable.[Defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the ReloCence] based on this: 759 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code.However, this article relates to defects that the work shown after delivery.[defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] argues that the work had not yet been delivered.He has insufficiently substantiated this claim.
4.31.
Furthermore, [defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] claims a declaration of right that [plaintiff in the convention/defendant in the counterclaim] has committed non -performance by "
The bill for the additional work
"Not to be satisfied.In addition, [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] claims payment of “
to increase the bill for additional work with the statutory interest from the date on which that amount was due and payable
".[defendant in Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] does not specify which note he is referring to his claim and also does not mention the date from which he is claiming statutory interest.There are several invoices in the file.In the conclusion of an answer also containing a counterclaim in the counterclaim, [defendant in the Convention/Plaintiff in the counterclaim] has added an invoice dated on 26 July 2019 stating: “
Subject: additional work, extra activities".This is the invoice referred to under r.o.2.2.e.In the invoice referred to under r.o.2.2.d.However, apparently a part of additional work is also included, since the original quotation was € 37,310.00 (see also 2.9.).The performance to be performed by [plaintiff in the proceedings/defendant in the counterclaim] is therefore insufficiently described in the award of the claim, which can cause problems in the enforcement.The court also ruled in the convention that the parties have nothing more to claim as a result of the dissolution over another, so that this claim is therefore not assignable.The conclusion is that the claims in the counterclaim will be rejected so far.
In the convention and counterclaim
4.32.
In view of the coherence between the claims in the convention and in the counterclaim and since the parties have been unsuccessful (partly), the court will compensate for the costs of the proceedings in the convention and in the counterclaim in the sense that each party bears its own costs.
