Lawyer mr. A. Hashem Jawaheri in Amsterdam.
The parties will hereinafter be referred to as [plaintiff] and [defendant].

The procedure
1.1.
[Plaintiff] explained the claims on the oral hearing of these summary proceedings on 11 October 2022.[Defendant] has put forward a defense.Both parties have brought productions and explained their views at the hearing.Judgment is determined today.
1.2.
The parties and their lawyers were present at the hearing.Both parties were assisted by an interpreter.
2
The facts
2.1.
Parties from Stadgenoot rent the house at the [address].
2.2.
Parties are the parents of [minor], born on [date of birth] 2015.
2.3.
The divorce between the parties was pronounced by order of 20 April 2022.
2.4.
On July 4, 2022, [defendant] started a substantive procedure at this court to continue the rent right of the home alone.
2.5.
By judgment of this court of 8 September 2022, the subdistrict court judge stipulated in summary proceedings that [defendant] is entitled to use the property to the exclusion of [plaintiff].In that judgment, as far as relevant, the following states:
“6. During the oral treatment, both parties are acknowledged that a great deal is currently being hurryed in the presence of [minor], which is accompanied by scolding and shouting from both sides.In the opinion of the subdistrict court judge, this is unacceptable in view of the importance of [minor] and the current situation is untenable.It is therefore not possible to wait for the outcome of the aforementioned soil procedure and an order measure is required.
7. The importance of [minor] is leading for the curriculum to be determined.Now that the parenting plan stipulates that [minor] has his main residence with [defendant] and she also has daily care for him, it is in the interest of [minor] that [defendant] will be entitled to use for this temporary situation for this temporary situationof the house.[minor] benefits from a quiet stable environment where his life at least changes as little as possible for the duration of the procedure, he can just go to school and time is to prepare for (possible) future changes.Moreover, it turned out that there are possibilities for [plaintiff] to at least stay with family temporarily.In view of the above, the claim of [defendant] will be granted in summary proceedings, (…).
8. [plaintiff] stated at the hearing through his lawyer that he was particularly afraid that if he now allows [defendant] (temporarily) to live in the home, it will be thought that he will give up his rental rights and will never return to therented, while it was originally his home and he also needs it for medical urgency.However, [defendant] has stated through her lawyer that she is not necessarily bound to the rented property in the longer term, but has no other options in the short term to live with [minor] elsewhere.(...) ”.
2.6.
[plaintiff] has left the house.
2.7.
The lawyer of [plaintiff] stated at the hearing that an appeal was lodged against the judgment of the subdistrict court judge.
3
The dispute
3.1.
[plaintiff] claims in summary - the feasibility of the judgment of the subdistrict court judge in suspension until the appeal lodged by [plaintiff] has been decided, by order [defendant] to pay the costs of the proceedings.
3.2.[plaintiff] states the following for this.His health is bad.He was assigned the house in 2008 on the basis of medical urgency because he cannot walk stairs.His relatives and friends have abandoned him and offered him no shelter.He sleeps in his car at night.Sometimes he can sleep with a son.Now that the nights get colder, his health will deteriorate.[plaintiff] has a UWV benefit.[defendant] has more financial resources to involve a different living space.Moreover, she has a friend with whom she could stay.[Defendant] stated on this in violation of the truth during the oral treatment at the subdistrict court judge.[Defendant] makes an abuse of rights by executing the judgment of the subdistrict court judge, because she has stated to the subdistrict court judge that she has no friend with whom she can spend the night.[Defendant] also wrongly stated in the canton procedure that there is an untenable situation between the parties that means that they can no longer live together in the home.Furthermore, [defendant] knows about the poor health situation of [plaintiff].This also means that she abuses her authority to execute the judgment of the subdistrict court judge.
3.3.
[defendant] defends.
3.4.
The statements of the parties are discussed below, insofar as relevant.
4
The assessment
4.1.
In a standard execution difference, the starting point, in short, is that a pronounced conviction, hanging a higher provision, must be enforceable, but that in special cases, if the feasibility is not motivated in stock, a balancing of interests of this principle can justify (highCouncil December 20, 2019, ECLI: NL: HR: 2019: 2026).In this summary proceedings, the starting point is slightly more nuanced.In matters between former partners with (a) child (ren) in which, by way of provisional provision, the exclusively use of the former marital home is temporarily assigned to one of the former partners, the importance of their child (ren) is paramount.The importance of [minor] is also paramount in this summary proceedings.
4.2.
The subdistrict court judge has considered that the interests of [minor] are leading for his decision.Subsequently, the subdistrict court judge considered that it is in the interest of [minor] that [defendant] stays in the home, because [minor] has his main residence with her, she also has the daily care for [minor] and he benefits from aQuiet stable environment.This importance of [minor] is now no different.
4.3.
According to [plaintiff], the subdistrict court judge did not address his defense that he needs the home due to medical urgency.In his judgment, the subdistrict court judge expressed this defense of [plaintiff] and ruled in the assessment that the importance of [minor] is leading.It can be deduced from this that the subdistrict court judge did not consider the medical urgency set by [plaintiff] to stay in the home decisive.Why that should be the case now has not been shown.
4.4.
[plaintiff] has not made it plausible that [defendant] stated against the truth in the procedure at the subdistrict court that she has no friend.In this summary proceedings at the hearing, [defendant] stated when asked that it is a early friendship, at least she is only friends with that person, but at least she cannot withdraw from him with [minor].The question of whether [defendant] has alternative living space can also remain in the middle, because [plaintiff] stated at the hearing that he did not expect [defendant] that she will leave the house, in the event that this summary proceedings lead to him in thehome can return.
4.5.
Finally, [plaintiff] argued that [defendant] is abusing authority to execute the judgment because she knows about his medical situation.Whether [defendant] knows about the medical complaints of [plaintiff] is not relevant.The point is that the subdistrict court judge has not regarded the medical situation of [plaintiff] as a compelling interest that it states that he leaves the house (temporarily).
4.6.
The above means that the claim of [plaintiff] is rejected.
4.7.
The costs of the proceedings will be settled, as usual in procedures between ex-courts.
5
The decision
The preliminary relief judge
5.1.
refuses the requested facilities,
5.2.
settles the costs of this procedure between the parties, in the sense that each party bears its own costs.
This verdict was given by mr. E.A.Messer, preliminary relief judge, assisted by M.F.van Grootheest, clerk, and pronounced in public on October 25, 2022.
