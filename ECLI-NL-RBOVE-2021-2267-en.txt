The procedure
1.1.
[plaintiff] this summary proceedings started her summons of 23 April 2021.
Mr.Jawaheri has sent a print of a WhatsApp conversation in advance.
1.2.
The oral treatment took place on 12 May 2021 via a video connection.[plaintiff] appeared in this, assisted by mr. Çakir.[Defendant 2] and [defendant 3] have also appeared, where [defendant 2] and [defendant 1] were assisted by Jawaheri.The clerk has made notes of what parties have discussed.
1.3.
After the oral hearing, the subdistrict court judge arrested the case with a view to settlement negotiations.The parties then announced that they have not reached agreement.The subdistrict court judge has been sufficiently informed to make a decision in this case.She will communicate that decision and the explanation of this in this judgment today.

The decision summarized
2.1.
[plaintiff] has made it plausible that she has concluded an employment contract for an indefinite period of time with [defendant 1].There is no legally valid end to that employment contract.That is why the subdistrict court judge condemns defendants to pay the overdue and future salary to [plaintiff].

The assessment
What is this case about?
3.1.
[plaintiff] entered the service of [defendant 1] as a general employee on 16 November 2020.[defendant 1] has not paid the salary of [plaintiff] since February 2021. This case revolves around whether [plaintiff] is entitled to pay her arrears and future salary.
What preceded this dispute.
3.2.
On November 20, 2020, [plaintiff] signed an employment contract, which she concluded with [defendant 1].The written employment contract states that it was adopted for an average of 27.5 hours per week on 16 November 2020 and that it earns a gross hourly wage of € 10.51.In November and December 2020, [defendant 1] paid the salary of [plaintiff] in accordance with that agreement.
3.3.
In a letter of 14 December 2020, which was signed by [defendant 3] on behalf of [defendant 1], it states that the employment contract has been changed:
In this way we inform you that this fixed -term employment contract will be converted into an agreement for an indefinite period.The employment contract is entered into for an average of 38 hours per week with a gross monthly wage of € 2097.85
.
Two salary specifications were then drawn up (January and February 2021), which states that the wage has been paid in accordance with these new agreements.
3.4.
[plaintiff] worked in the bakery until the end of February 2021.
What [plaintiff] wants.
3.5.
[plaintiff] wants the subdistrict court judge [defendant 1] and her partners to condemn to meet the overdue salary for the months of February and March 2021.That is an amount of € 4,195.70 gross.She also wants [defendant 1] to specify the salary on a salary slip.The wage was not paid on time.That is why [plaintiff] is entitled to legal increase and reimbursement of the statutory interest.
3.6.
[plaintiff] believes that she is still employed by [defendant 1].[plaintiff] therefore requires that [defendant 1] and her partners are sentenced to continue to pay the monthly salary of € 2,097.85 gross to her from April 2021 until the employment contract has been legally terminated.
3.7.
Finally, [plaintiff] demands reimbursement of the extrajudicial collection costs (€ 834.51) and the costs of the proceedings, including an amount of follow -up costs.
The defense against that.
3.8.
[defendant 2] has explained that the general partnership was dissolved under the company [defendant 1].He continues the company under the same name as a one -man business.
3.9.[defendant 2] disputes that he owes wages to [plaintiff].[plaintiff] has canceled the employment contract.According to [defendant 2], this is apparent from the whatsapp conversation submitted.
Furthermore, [defendant 2] disputed that [defendant 1] has concluded an employment contract with [plaintiff] for an indefinite period of time.The letter of 14 December 2020 was drawn up at the request of [plaintiff] so that she could take out a mortgage.It was not the intention of the parties that [plaintiff] was employed indefinitely.Finally, according to [defendant 2], [plaintiff] was not available for
labor from March 2021.
3.10.
According to [defendant 3], the amendment to the agreement, as described in the letter of 14 December 2020, was indeed intended by the parties.After that, according to him, the
employment contract.
3.11.
[defendant 3] has explained that he left the company.He has passed on that change to the Chamber of Commerce.In the week prior to the oral
Treatment of the summary proceedings was also issued by the company.That is why [defendant 3] believes that he is at most responsible for the overdue salary.
The judgment of the subdistrict court judge.
3.12.
[plaintiff] asks you to make an urgent decision and is therefore summary proceedings
started.The difference with a regular procedure (soil procedure) is that the claimant must have an urgent interest in the requested rapid decision and that the speed of the procedure means that there is no time to hear witnesses, for example.This case is about the wages of an employee.Such a claim is generally urgent and the urgent interest has not been contradicted by the defendants.
3.13.
It is certain that [plaintiff] concluded an employment contract with [defendant 1].Two points of dispute arose about her employment contract.
1. Has the agreement been changed later to an employment contract for an indefinite period of time?
2. Has the employment contract ended legally?
The subdistrict court judge answers the first question with "yes" and the second with "no".She explains that below.
[plaintiff] has an employment contract for an indefinite period of time with [defendant 1].
3.14.
In the opinion of the subdistrict court judge, [plaintiff] has made it plausible that she has concluded an employment contract for an indefinite period of time, as stated in the letter of 14 December 2020. In the first place, [A] has during the oral hearing
Recognized that his son [defendant 3] made this adjustment to the employment contract.According to him, that was also explicitly intended, because the bakery needed staff.[Defendant 2] did not show that [defendant 3] was not authorized to
Comes to close.[defendant 3] therefore bound [defendant 1] to the employment contract for an indefinite period of time with [plaintiff].
3.15.
[Defendant 2] states that this employment contract was not in accordance with the intention of the parties.But [defendant 1] actually paid the agreed higher salary in January 2021.[defendant 1] therefore also acted on the agreements from the letter of 14 December 2020. And furthermore [defendant 2] repeatedly stated during the oral hearing that he was not concerned with the financial side of the company and knew nothingof the contracts that [defendant 3] had concluded.In view of this, in the opinion of the subdistrict court judge, [defendant 2] made his claim that the letter of 14 December 2020 only served before receiving the mortgage, made insufficient plausible.
Has the employment contract ended legally?
3.16.
The starting point in employment law is that only the employee can terminate the employment contract for an indefinite period of time by canceling it.If the employer the
Employment contract against the wishes of the employee wants to terminate, he needs permission from UWV or if he has to ask the subdistrict court judge to terminate the employment contract.It is certain that [defendant 1] did not follow those procedures.There is also no immediate dismissal.
3.17.
[defendant 2] says that [plaintiff] has canceled her employment contract himself, or at least agreed to a mutual termination of employment.[Plaintiff] has that
disputed.That is why [defendant 2] will have to make it plausible that [plaintiff] has clearly and unambiguously made her wish known to terminate the employment.
3.18.[defendant 2] believes that the termination of the employment contract by [plaintiff] is evident from the whatsapp conversation submitted.The subdistrict court judge judges differently.The relevant WhatsApp interview starts about the range of the bakery.On March 9, 2021, [plaintiff] and [defendant 2] met in the bakery for an interview.[plaintiff] asks on 11 March 2021 to let us know "what you want to do".There was no immediate response.On March 24, 2021, [plaintiff] asks the following:
"I wondered when you are planning to pay my final settlement.As you know, we are busy with our home and I desperately need the money. "
[defendant 2] announced on March 30, 2021 that [plaintiff] can come by to handle this, but [defendant 2] did not respond to the question of what time that appointment can take place.The submitted WhatsApp conversation does not show any explicit termination of the employment contract by [plaintiff].[Defendant 2] also does not write a proposal to terminate the employment contract with which [plaintiff] has agreed.At most, it can follow that [plaintiff] and [defendant 2] discussed between 11 March and 24 March that [defendant 2] draws up a final settlement.But whether that was in the context of a previously agreed termination of the employment contract does not follow.
3.19.
During the oral hearing, [defendant 2] explained that he and his father had been discussing the termination of the company [defendant 1] with [plaintiff].In addition, the intention would be that [plaintiff] would remain employed by [defendant 1], who would continue [defendant 2] as a sole proprietorship.But because [plaintiff] thereby set conditions, [defendant 2] wanted to pay € 1,000.00 and draw up a final settlement.The subdistrict court judge is of the opinion that [defendant 2] has not stated sufficiently clear and precisely about when the conversation took place.Also, [defendant 2] did not make it clear that [plaintiff] actually agreed to the termination of the employment contract during the aforementioned interview.What [defendant 2] has in fact stated is that the parties were still in discussions about a termination or any continuation of the employment, but that the summary proceedings have ended the conversations.In any case, agreement has not been the case.
3.20.
All in all, the subdistrict court judge concludes that [defendant 2] has not made it plausible that a legally valid end to the employment contract between [plaintiff] and [defendant 1].This means that [plaintiff] is entitled to payment of her salary.
The overdue salary.
3.21.
The employer of [plaintiff] is a general partnership (VOF).With a VOF, every partner is private liable for the entire debt of the VOF.Even if the debts have been made by another partner.This is stated in Article 18 of the Commercial Code.That is why [plaintiff] may address both [defendant 1] and the two partners on her overdue salary.
3.22.
According to [defendant 2], [plaintiff] is not entitled to payment of her salary, because since the end of February 2021 she has not worked and has not announced that she has been available to pick up her work.It is established that [defendant 2] asked [plaintiff] at the end of February 2021 to stay at home.He said it was because of an incident in the bakery, after which he closed the bakery for some time.In such a situation it is on the employer's way to call the employee for work as soon as the cause of the company closure has been removed.[defendant 2] does not state that he asked [plaintiff] to come and work again and that [plaintiff] refused.It must therefore be assumed that [plaintiff] was available for the agreed work and that the cause of not working lies with [defendant 1].The consequence of this is that [plaintiff] is entitled to pay her overdue salary.
3.23.
[plaintiff] did not receive her salary on time.The employer is obliged to pay the wage on time and if he does not, he owes the legal increase as a sanction.This is regulated in Article 7: 625 of the Dutch Civil Code.Against this, the defendants did not have a separate defense.The law does give the court the power to limit the increase if it occurs fairly.With a view to that authority, the subdistrict court judge limits the legal increase to 15%, also because it is an assessment in summary proceedings.In addition, the employer must reimburse the statutory interest.
The future salary.
3.24.When it comes to "new" debts of the VOF that have arisen after one of the partners has resigned, the outgoing partner is not always liable for those new debts.[defendant 2] and [defendant 3] have explained that the company agreement between both of them has been terminated.[defendant 3] believes that he is therefore not responsible for continuing the salary of [plaintiff] from his retirement from the company.The subdistrict court judge leaves the middle whether [defendant 3] has the right on his side, because the parties have not sufficiently demonstrated that [defendant 3] actually resigned.It is mandatory to register the termination of the VOF in the trade register of the Chamber of Commerce.That registration is necessary to protect the creditors of the VOF.It is certain that on April 20, 2021 it was registered in the Trade Register that [defendant 3] and [defendant 2] are partners of [defendant 1].That something went wrong at De Post, as [defendant 3] claims, has not been demonstrated and is for his account.The conclusion is that both partners are also liable for payment of the future salary of [plaintiff].
The salary specifications.
3.25.
The salary must always be specified by law.That is why the subdistrict court judge will condemn the defendants of their salary payments to provide a correct salary specification to [plaintiff].
The extrajudicial collection costs.
3.26.
[plaintiff] wants a reimbursement of the extrajudicial collection costs she has incurred to get payment of her salary.According to [plaintiff], those costs are € 834.51.The extrajudicial activities related to the overdue salary, including the maximum legal increase of 50%.The subdistrict court judge has awarded a lower amount.That is why the subdistrict court judge calculates the reimbursement on the basis of the reimbursement of extrajudicial collection costs on the basis of the lower allocated amount.[plaintiff] is granted a reimbursement for the extrajudicial collection costs for € 544.57.
Finally.
3.27.
The defendants are unsuccessful.They are therefore ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings.On the part of [plaintiff], those costs are estimated at twice an amount of € 115.03 for the issuing of the two summons and € 85.00 for the court fees that [plaintiff] has paid to the court.[plaintiff] has been assisted by a lawyer.The defendants also have to pay those legal assistance costs.The subdistrict court judge estimates the costs for legal aid on the basis of fixed rates, in this case € 747.00.In total, the costs of the proceedings amount to € 1,062.06.The follow -up costs are estimated at the maximum rate of € 124.00.
