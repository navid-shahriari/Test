2.2
The oral hearing of the request for suspension took place on 23 June 2020.In addition, the man was represented by his lawyer.The woman has appeared in person, assisted by her lawyer.
2.3
By decision of this Court of 14 July 2020 (case number 200.277.474/02), the operation of the contested decision was suspended insofar as it concerns the decision on the bridal gift (part 3.2 of the dictum of the contested decision).
2.4
The oral treatment of the main issue took place on January 21, 2021 via Skype for Business in connection with the COVID-19 Virus.The parties were present, assisted by their lawyers.There was also Mrs. [A], Tolk Farsi, who translated for both parties.
3
The facts
3.1
The man and the woman are married [in] 2015 in [B], Iran.They both only have Iranian nationality.
3.2
The woman submitted a request for divorce on 12 June 2019 and for the taking of secondary facilities.The man has put forward a defense and made independent requests.
3.3
The divorce was pronounced between the parties at the decision [in] 2020.The divorce decision was registered on 26 August 2020 in the registers of the Civil Registry in The Hague.
3.4
In addition to expressing the divorce, the court has in the contested decision:
-
stipulates that the man will pay an amount of € 506,610 to the woman in the context of the bridal gift, as equivalent of 600 Bahar-Azadi Gold coins, which amount will be plus the statutory interest if the man does not do this amount within twoweeks after the service of the decision has been paid to the woman and declared this provision enforceable in stock;
-
the man declared inadmissible in his independent requests;
-
the costs of the proceedings compensated in the sense that the parties each bear their own costs;and
-
the more or other requested rejected.
4
The size of the dispute
4.1
Between the parties, the bridal gift to be delivered to the woman, complications about a holiday home in Iran and the contribution requested by the woman by the man in her livelihood are in dispute.
4.2
The man appealed with four complaints of the contested decision.See the first and second complaint on the bridal gift, the third complaint relates to his independent requests concerning a holiday home in respect of which he has been declared inadmissible.There is no independent meaning to the fourth complaint, so that it will not be discussed separately.The man requests the court:
primarythe woman in her introductory (amended) request to determine that the man must be declared € 506,610 with the statutory interest, at least to declare it inadmissible, at least that request to reject that request;
to determine that the holiday home in Iran is due to the woman and that the woman must pay half the value, an amount of € 10,909 to the man;
alternative
:
to determine that the man 110 Bahar-Azadi must meet gold coins and to reject the "surplus";
more in the alternative
:
to set the equivalent of 600 Bahar-Azadi Golden Coins at an amount of € 145,441.44 and for the rest of the request of the woman to be rejected;
All this costs legally.
4.3
The woman defends and requests the man to declare inadmissible or to declare his complaints unfounded and reject his requests.
4.4
In turn, the woman with one complaint came into an incidental appeal.The complaint sees on her rejected request to determine a contribution to her livelihood to be paid by the man.She requests the Court of Appeal to destroy the contested decision on that part and to determine that the man must pay a contribution to her livelihood of € 1,980 per month, always to pay in advance.
5
The reasons for the decision
the bridal gift
5.1
Just like the court, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the Dutch court is entitled to jurisdiction with regard to the divorce and with regard to the related side facilities.The Court of Appeal is also of the opinion that the request on the bridal gift is a secondary provision within the meaning of Article 827 paragraph 1 sub f of the Code of Civil Procedure, because the request sees a regulation of the consequences of the divorce.
5.2
On the basis of the Hague matrimonial property treaty 1978, the court ruled that the joint national law of the parties applies to their matrimonial property regime from the date of the wedding ceremony.In this case that is Iranian law.With regard to the applicable right to the woman's request on the bridal gift, the court has ruled that this should be assessed under Iranian law, now that the entitlement to that bridal gift must be assessed under the right to which the entitlement about the bridal gift tohas come.In this case it is a marriage concluded by Iranian law, so that the request with regard to the bridal gift must also be assessed under Iranian law.
5.3
The parties themselves also assume Iranian law with regard to the bridal gift.The Court of Appeal will therefore take the judgments of the court on this section as a starting point for the further assessment.
5.4
In his first complaint, the man states that the court wrongly converted the agreement in the marriage certificate with regard to the satisfaction of Golden Coins in paying a sum of money in euros.The marriage certificate only states that the parties have agreed that the man should provide the woman to the woman in the event of divorce 600 Bahar-Azadi, not that he can also pay the equivalent in money instead.According to Iranian law, this is only possible if this is also explicitly included in the marriage certificate, but this is not the case here.Furthermore, according to Iranian law, the man states in the first instance that he can only be obliged to meet the first 110 gold coins to the woman and that an arrangement is made for the superior ("the surplus").Proceded about the surplus, whereby the judge takes, among other things, the capacity and capital.In this context, he points to a report from the International Legal Institute (IJI), which was submitted by the woman in first instance as Appendix 1 with her defense on the self -employed requests of the man.Finally, the man states that he now has no income, so that his capacity for the surplus is nil.
5.5
The woman leads the following.In Dutch case law, the issue of Iranian bridal gifts has already crystallized.This shows that instead of coins the equivalent of this can also be paid in money.That is also practical in this case, because the man states that he has no gold coins in the Netherlands.The man explains the IJI report incorrectly;The fact that this can be litigated from 110 coins does not mean that the surplus convenience can be put on nil.The man has a good job, deserves
€ 4,612 per month and works as a knowledge migrant with a good friend of his.When the man's statement that he now has no income, the woman therefore questions her.
5.6The court considers as follows.It is not in dispute between the parties that it was agreed in the marriage certificate that the man 600 Bahar-Azadi should meet Gold Coins.The woman has appealed to that appointment.For practical reasons, however, because the man has indicated that she did not have such gold coins in the Netherlands, she requested that payment can also be made in money in its equivalent.On behalf of the woman, the oral treatment was once again confirmed that payment as far as the woman is concerned is both in Bahar-Azadi Golden Coins and in Money.In view of this, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the satisfaction of the bridal gift in Bahar-Azadi Golden Coins must be done, now that none of the parties have objections.Moreover, the oral treatment showed that the man has been staying in Iran for a few months now.It has neither been stated nor proved that he cannot get Bahar-Azadi gold coins there.On the oral hearing, the man's lawyer even stated that if the woman also comes to Iran, parties can arrange the issue in gold coins.In that respect, therefore, complaint 1 of the man succeeds.
5.7
In the piece of IJi submitted by the woman on page 9, among other things:
"
If it is a claim above 110 Bahar Azadi Gold pieces (...), then it must be litigated and the man's capacity can be taken into account in the judicial decision on claims with regard to the (deferred) bridal gift that is even higher.A repayment in installments is then possible, for example.However, the woman's claim for the 'surplus' remains due and payable from the moment the man has sufficient capacity or financial room for repaying the bridal gift.
"
None of the parties disputes the accuracy of this quote, whatever quote to parties on the oral hearing by the chairman.The parties therefore agree that the man must pay at least 110 Bahar-Azadi Gold Coins to the woman and that a payment arrangement can be established for the multiple (the "surplus").The capacity and/or financial space of the man plays a role in this.
5.8
With regard to the latter, the man stated that he is currently unemployed, has no income and has been living with his parents in Iran for a few months.His parents are already paying his costs.In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the woman has insufficiently disputed this and the Court therefore assumes that the man currently has no income.As a result, he lacks the capacity.In view of this, the court will condemn the man to pay the surplus in installments and one Bahar-Azadi gold coin per year.His first complaint also succeeds.This does not alter the fact that the woman, in the event of changed circumstances, can request a change in this payment scheme.
5.9
The second complaint of the man, who also relates to the bridal gift, is conditional.Now that this condition (in the event that the court, just like the court, would start from a payment in money instead of Golden Coins) has not been met, complaint 2 no longer needs a discussion.
The holiday home in Iran
5.10
In his third complaint, the man states that he was wrongly declared inadmissible in his independent request with regard to the holiday home in Iran.The court did not regard this request as an ancillary provision for divorce.The woman can agree with the court's opinion.
5.11
Unlike the court, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the man's request is sufficiently coherent with the request for divorce, because it relates to the property settlement between the parties.The request can therefore be made in these proceedings on the basis of Article 827, paragraph 1, preamble and under f, RV.The Dutch court has jurisdiction, in view of the provisions of Article 4, paragraph 3, of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure.
5.12
Because the house is located in Iran, is on the EIranian law.In view of the propositions that the parties have taken in the first instance and the documents submitted, it is established that the property was jointly purchased by the parties for an amount of IRR 850,000,000 (850 million Iranian Rial).The home has thus become their common property.The woman has contributed an amount of IRR 280,000,000 from her own resources, the man an amount of IRR 305,000,000 and not as stated in the appeal IRR 350,000,000.The remaining amount when purchasing is borrowed from the bank.The woman has stated that she has repaid the bank's loan.The man has given the woman a power of attorney to sell the property, but the woman used it to put the home in her own name.The man claims an amount of the woman (in euros) equal to the value of the home he sets.According to the man, this value is € 11,356.46.Half of that is € 5,678.23.
5.13
The Court of Appeal sees no reason to determine that the woman must reimburse the man half of the value of the home.After all, the man's investment is less than half the value of the home, now that the parties have borrowed part of the bank's purchase price and the woman has repaid that loan.It is true that an amount of IRR 305,000,000 from the man's assets has ended up with the woman, without the man having agreed.The woman must reimburse this amount to the man.The Court of Appeal also sees no reason on this point to convert the amount to euros, all the more now that the man is currently staying in Iran, but has kept in mind that an amount of IRR 305,000,000 at the current exchange rateroughly corresponds to the amount that the man progresses in euros.Complaint 3 of the man succeeds.
the partner alimony
5.14
In the incidental appeal, the woman states in her only complaint that the court wrongly rejected her request for partner alimony.Her positions mean that the center of its interests is in the Netherlands and that her request for partner alimony must therefore be assessed under Dutch law.The man disputes that.
5.15
For the assessment of which law applies, the Court of Appeal will use the date of the decision at first instance (6 April 2020).If requested, this date was also mentioned by both parties as an assessment moment.
5.16
The assessment criterion stems from Article 3 of the Haags Protocol 2007. As the court has also considered, according to that article, the right of the country of the habitual residence of the maintenance entitled person applies to the request for partner alimony.According to settled case law, the habitual residence is the place where someone has established the permanent center of their interests with the intention of granting a fixed character.
5.17
The man came to the Netherlands as a highly skilled migrant in August 2018.The woman came to the Netherlands in March 2019 and had a temporary residence permit for her husband.On 12 June 2019, the woman submitted a request for divorce.Due to the subsequent divorce, that temporary residence permit of the woman cannot be maintained.The woman has - as she stated on the oral hearing - runs several procedures to obtain a new residence permit.The woman has no work, no benefit and hardly speaks Dutch.She stays with her sister and brother -in -law who pay her livelihood costs.Now that the divorce has expired the stay with her husband, a different purpose of residence will have to be attached to the new residence permit.For her movers, however, the woman did not want to give insight into her applications for a residence permit or the status thereof.The Court of Appeal therefore cannot judge that the center of its interests is located in the Netherlands.The only connection with the Netherlands that the woman now has concrete is that her sister lives in the Netherlands and that she actually stays there.However, that is insufficient for the Court.
5.18
The foregoing leads the Court of Appeal to the conclusion that the woman has insufficiently demonstrated that the center of her interests is in the Netherlands and that Dutch law applies at its request for determining and partner alimony.That is why her complaint does not succeed.
6
The conclusion
6.1
On the basis of what has been considered above, the first and third complaint of the man succeed.His second complaint does not need a discussion.The woman's complaint in the incidental appeal does not succeed.The Court of Appeal will annull the contested decision, insofar as it is subject to its judgment, insofar as it is subject to its judgment and decide on those parts as mentioned below.
6.2The Court of Appeal will compensate the costs of the proceedings on appeal, now that the parties are former spouses and the proceedings are the settlement of their dissolved marriage.
