Introduction
1.1.
[plaintiff] and [defendant] currently both have a barber shop in the center of Leiden for which they use the same name: Hair Salon Promise.The only difference is that [defendant] writes the name with the number 1 behind it.They both want the other person to use a different name, because it is confusing to the public if they have a barber shop with the same name at such a short distance from each other.That is why [plaintiff] has requested the summary proceedings in this case (also: the preliminary relief judge) ("in the convention") to prohibit [defendant] to use the name.In response ("in counterclaim"), [defendant] asked the preliminary relief judge to prohibit [plaintiff] to use the name.
1.2.
The preliminary relief judge decides in this judgment that it is [defendant] (and not [plaintiff]) who for the time being should stop using the name Kapsalon Promise for its hairdressing store.A ban is therefore imposed on [defendant] to make use of that name.That decision is for the time being because this is a summary proceedings: a short procedure for a situation that is urgent.The decision is intended to determine what should be done in the period after the judgment, until another judge (the soil judge) has assessed the case in full procedure.[plaintiff] must start a procedure at the soil court within six months of this judgment.If she does not, it can lose her strength imposed on [defendant].
1.3.
The preliminary relief judge explains below how and why she came to this judgment.Under "The procedure", it is now first listed what the course of the summary proceedings has been procedure.Subsequently, under "the facts" that the parties agree and what is certain that they happened between them in the run -up to this procedure.In her opinion, the preliminary relief judge is released from those facts.After that, "the dispute" shows what the claims of [plaintiff] and [defendant] are and why they believe they are entitled to it.Ultimately, under "the assessment", the preliminary relief judge explains its judgment on all claims, in order to display the decisions that follow from them under "the decision".

The procedure
2.1.
The course of the procedure is evident from:
-
the application for summary proceedings of 15 February 2021;
-
The e-mail of the registry of 11 March 2021, where [plaintiff] is reported that the summary proceedings are scheduled on 28 May 2021 and that the summons with the 'Court of The Hague in the Court of Courts' (hereinafter: the instructions) (with dates and deadlines for the appearance and submission of documents) must be served to [defendant] by 16 March 2021 at the latest;
-
the decision of the preliminary relief judge of 27 May 2021 that the planned oral treatment on 28 May 2021 will not take place because the instructions were not served by [plaintiff] to [defendant], therefore [defendant] was not aware of the mannerand time of appearance in this summary proceedings and [defendant] did not voluntarily appear to appear on the oral hearing on 28 May 2021;
-
the e-mails of 27 and 28 May 2021 in which [plaintiff] and [defendant] were requested to give up foreclosure dates and a digital session is planned on 29 June 2021 on 29 June 2021;
-
The again, with the correct instructions, meant a summons of 8 June 2021, with productions EP01-EP10;
-
the conclusion of the answer from [defendant], received by e-mail of 15 June 2021, which includes a claim in the counterclaim, with productions GP01-GP06;
-
the reactive productions of [plaintiff], submitted by e-mail of 22 June 2021, with four productions, which will be called EP11-EP14;-
the written pleading memorandum of [plaintiff], received by e-mail of 25 June 2021;
-
the written plea of [defendant], received by e-mail of 27 June 2021;
-
The proceedings overviews of both parties, received by e-mails of 28 June 2021.
2.2.
On June 29, 2021, the oral treatment (because of the COVID-19 virus) took place in a digital way.In addition, [plaintiff] appeared, assisted by
A. Hashem Jawaheri, and [defendant], assisted by E. Balikci.
2.2.1.
In the oral hearing, [plaintiff] raised that [defendant] would have submitted the written pleading memorandum too late.According to the instructions, [defendant] should have submitted the pleading memorandum no later than Friday 25 June 2021 at 10 am, but she did not do that until Sunday 27 June 2021 late in the evening.According to [plaintiff], the written plea memorandum should be refused, since Hashem Jawaheri has now had (too) little time to discuss the pleading with [plaintiff] for the oral hearing.In addition, according to [plaintiff], it must be assumed that [defendant] did not give up the amount of the costs of the proceedings, because she was too late.
2.2.2.
The preliminary relief judge rejected the objection to the written pleading memorandum of [defendant] for the reason that [plaintiff] was not damaged in its procedural interest by submitting it at 27 instead of on 25 June 2021.With the conclusion received on 15 June 2021, [plaintiff] was aware of the position of [defendant] and the short written pleading of [defendant], which has already been a new positions compared to that conclusionof answer.In this case, [defendant] could also have chosen not not to submit a written advocate, but to be further articulated its position on the oral hearing of 29 June 2021.
2.2.3.
The preliminary relief judge postponed the decision on the remark of [plaintiff] on the costs of the proceedings of [defendant] to the judgment.
2.3.
At the end of the oral treatment, the preliminary relief judge determined that this judgment will be given today.

The facts
3.1.
[Defendant] has driven a barber shop in the [Pand1] in Leiden under the name "Kapsalon Promise".Before she started with her barber shop on the [Pand1], since 2003 a hairdressing shop has been driven by one [X] (hereinafter also: the old owner) at the same address and under the same name.[Defendant] has taken over the hairdressing business from him at some point.The building was rented by (the old owner and then by) [defendant].
3.2.
[plaintiff] has worked as a hairdresser for several years in the hairdressing store of [defendant] at the [Pand1] in Leiden.
3.3.
After [defendant] indicated that he wanted to stop the barber shop, [defendant] and [plaintiff] had discussions about a takeover thereof by [plaintiff].They ultimately reached agreement and drawn up a handwritten contract that has been signed by both of them (and by two family members of [plaintiff]).The contract exists
- as far as relevant - from the following text:
Concerns the acquisition of Hair Salon Promise in Leiden
[Pand1] (…)
Hereby I pay € 25,000 (five-name thousand euros) today [plaintiff] (29/02/20)
mr.[defendant] to complete the acquisition of Kapsalon Promise.
I transferred the remaining € 15,000 (fifteen thousand euros) on 22/02/20 to the account of [defendant].
€ 6,000 (six thousand euros) is still transferred to account [defendant] (amount for deposit).
3.4.
On 29 February 2020, [plaintiff] and the owner of the building on the [Pand1] in Leiden signed a lease agreement for the property (hereinafter: the lease agreement), in which agreement the following text is included under the heading 'Special Provisions' andIncluding [defendant] also put her signature:
This lease agreement has been drawn up because Mrs. [defendant] (...) has found a business successor in Mrs. [plaintiff].With the signing of this article, Mrs [defendant] to agree to this new lease as well as to cancel the content thereof and its existing lease with effect from the commencement date of this agreement.The parties give each other relief and again with regard to the previous lease.
3.5.
[plaintiff] has submitted Screen Shots that were made with her phone made of WhatsApp interviews with the same person in February and March 2020 about
- among other things - the deposit for the rented building on the [Pand1], keys and a bank still to be picked up.Below are some parts of the ideas exchanged, where the text of [plaintiff] can always be read on the right (against the green background).
On March 3, 2020:
After the other person sent copies of the lease on March 4, 2020:
On March 17, 2020:
and on March 28, 2020:
3.6.After the takeover, [plaintiff] continued to use the name "Kapsalon Promise" (hereinafter: the trade name) for the hairdressing store at the [Pand1] in Leiden.
3.7.
On November 2, 2020, [defendant] started a barber shop at the [Pand2] in Leiden under the name "Kapsalon Promise 1".With a poster, via Instagram and on the facade of the building, [defendant] announced the opening of her hairdressing store at this location in the following way.
3.8.
[defendant] submitted Screen Shots of between [plaintiff] and a person who calls himself "[X]" on 4 and 6 November 2020 exchanged WhatsApp messages, of which parts are included below.The messages from [plaintiff] are always left (against the white background).
3.9.
By letter of 13 November 2020, Kapsalon Promise V.O.F.With the subject of "Intraducing (image) brand promise" to [plaintiff] that she is not allowed to use the name "Promise" for her hairdressing store.
3.10.
Kapsalon Promise V.O.F.(hereinafter: the VOF), according to an extract from the register of the Chamber of Commerce, is based in Drachten.The VOF uses (among other things) the internet address www.kapsalonpromise.nl.According to the website linked to that internet address, the VOF currently has twelve branches in the north of the Netherlands, such as in Drachten, Emmen, Franeker, Groningen, Veendam and Zuidhorn, and one branch in Leiden.Both the address at the [Pand1] in Leiden (under the 'Home' tab at the LEGNER) and the address at the [Pand2] in Leiden (under the 'All Salons' tab when mentioning Kapsalon Promise in Leiden) isas location of the VOF on the website of the VOF.
3.11.
The VOF is the holder of the Benelux logo registered below on 5 May 2016 under number 990954, for class 14, including services of Kapsalons (hereinafter: the brand).
3.12.
By letter of 23 March 2020 (which was reminded by e-mail of 29 April 2020), a lawyer requested that on behalf of the VOF [plaintiff] to stop using the trade name and indicated that legal proceedings will be started if they are to thatRequest does not respond.By e-mail of April 29, 2021, Hashem Jawaheri responded to this letter on behalf of [plaintiff].[plaintiff] has not responded to the request.She is not (yet) involved by the VOF in legal proceedings.
3.13.
In this procedure, [defendant] submitted a written statement, dated 26 May 2021 and was signed in the name of the two partners of the VOF.That statement is as follows:
Ir/Madam,
We are the partners of Kapsalon Promise VOF and we have also deposited this trade name in the brand register.We have first granted [defendant] to the [Pand1] to the [Pand2] in Leiden, license to use our trade name.We were aware of the sale of the salon on the [Pand1] to Mrs. [plaintiff].We have not given Mrs. [plaintiff] permission to use our trade name that we have built up in almost twenty years now.Mrs. [plaintiff] was also aware of this and indicated after sale to change the name as quickly as possible and remove all expressions on the building.To date, she has refused this.We have therefore engaged a lawyer who addressed her about this, unfortunately without results.We will soon also start a lawsuit against Mrs. [plaintiff] in connection with the unlawful use of our trade name.
3.14.
The hairdressing store of [plaintiff] on the [Pand1] and the barber shop of [defendant] on the [Pand2] are both in the center of Leiden a three -minute walk (230 meters) from each other.

The dispute
In the convention and counterclaim
4.1.
In the convention, [plaintiff] claims that the preliminary relief judge prohibits the judgment to be declared enforceable in stock, [defendant], with effect from fourteen days after the service of this judgment, to use the trade name (with the addition of the figure 1), on penalty of a penalty of € 1,000 per day that she violates this prohibition, with a maximum of € 30,000, and by order [defendant] to pay the costs of the procedure on the basis of Article 1019h of the Code of Civil Procedure
1
.
4.2.
[plaintiff] argues to substantiate her claim that [defendant] acts contrary to Article 5 HNW
2By using the trade name for its hairdressing store at the [Pand2] in Leiden, at least that it acts unlawfully by using that name.Since the takeover of the barber shop at the [Pand1] on 29 February 2020, [plaintiff] has been making a right to use the trade name for a hairdressing store in Leiden on 29 February 2020.On that date, [defendant] transferred the hairdresser's business, including the trade name, to [plaintiff].By then starting a new hairdresser's shop at just a three -minute walk, with exactly the same trade name, only with the figure 1 behind it, [defendant] has caused that confusion with the public is inevitable.[Defendant] also deliberately ensured that customers cannot distinguish between the two hairdressing affairs in other ways.For example, with a poster and her Instagram account, she pointed out a "new location" of Kapsalon Promise and she announced the carrier of the Shuttle buses in the center of Leiden that Kapsalon Promise has changed location.[plaintiff] has seen the customer base of its hairdressing store at the [Pand1] halve, while she paid € 40,000 to [defendant] for that barber shop.
4.3.
[defendant] defends the claim of [plaintiff].According to [defendant], after the takeover, [plaintiff] did not have the right to continue to use the trade name for her hairdressing store at the [Pand1].The trade name did not belong to [defendant] but to the VOF, so that this name was not part of the takeover of the hairdressing store at the [Pand1] by [plaintiff].[plaintiff] knew that according to [defendant] too.It has explicitly agreed with [plaintiff] that she would look for a different name for the barber shop.[plaintiff] also did not receive permission from the VOF to use the trade name, according to [defendant].
4.4.
In the counterclaim, [defendant] claims that the preliminary relief judge prohibits the judgment to be declared enforceable in stock, [plaintiff], from seven days after the service of this judgment, to use the trade name, on pain of a penalty of €
4.5.
To substantiate her claim, [defendant] argues that it is precisely [plaintiff] who acts contrary to Article 5 of the HNW by using the trade name for her hairdressing store at the [Pand1], at least that she acts unlawfully by using that name.At the time of the acquisition, the VOF already used the trade name for its national chain of hairdressing shops.The right to the use of that name explicitly did not switch to [plaintiff] when taking over the hairdressing store and it has no permission from the VOF to use that name.It is therefore [plaintiff] who, with the permanent use of the trade name for her hairdressing store at the [Pand1] causes confusion among the public.
4.6.
The defense of [plaintiff] against the claim of [defendant] in the counterclaim corresponds to the reason for losing the claim in the convention.
4.7.
The statements of the parties are discussed below, insofar as relevant.
5
The assessment
In the convention and counterclaim
Article 5 HNW
5.1.
The question that is central to this case is who has the right to continue to use the trade name for its hairdressing store in Leiden and who should stop using that name.[plaintiff] and [defendant] agree that the use of the trade name for both hairdressing affairs, which are located in a very short distance apart in the center of Leiden, is undesirable and that the public is the audience of the hairdressing affairswill confuse each other (or to that name now the number 1 is added or not).Both [plaintiff] and [defendant] believe that with an appeal to Article 5 HNW, the other person has prohibited the use of the trade name (in the case of [defendant] with the addition of the figure 1).
5.2.
Pursuant to Article 5 of the HNW, it is forbidden to carry a trade name, which, before the company was driven under that name, was already lawfully fed by another, or that only deviates from its trade name to a small extent, all this insofar as thereof, Due to the nature of the two companies and the place where they are located, there is confusion between those companies.In other words, in the case of (almost) the same trade name, as in this case, the appeal to this article as 1) can succeed the trade name lawful, 2) the other person then started using the trade name and 3)originated.
The order of use: the VOF, then [plaintiff] and then [defendant]
5.3.When it comes to the order of use of the trade name, it is certain that when [plaintiff] took over the hairdresser's shop from the [Pand1] from [defendant], the trade name was already used for hairdressing affairs by the VOF, in any case for twelve branches inthe north of the Netherlands (see rov. 3.10).It also seems to be established that after the takeover of the hairdressing store at the [Pand1] no more location in Leiden, or because [plaintiff] took over the trade name for the hairdressing store at the [Pand1] on 29 February 2020(as [plaintiff] states) or because [plaintiff] had no permission from the VOF for the use of the trade name (as [defendant] states).After the takeover of the barber shop at the [Pand1] up to the opening of the barber shop at the [Pand2], the VOF therefore used the trade name for hairdressing affairs in the north of the Netherlands and [plaintiff] simultaneously made use of the same trade name forHer hairdressing store at the [Pand1] in Leiden.When [defendant] later decided in 2020 to start another hairdresser's shop in Leiden and opened the hairdresser's shop to the [Pand2] on November 2, 2020, the trade name in Leiden was already used (namely: still after the acquisition) for the hairdresser's shopof [plaintiff] on the [building1].That order of use of the trade name is important for the question of who can be regarded as "one" as referred to in the condition referred to above under 1), and who as "the other" as referred to in the condition mentioned above)In the context of Article 5 HNW.
5.4.
For example, [plaintiff] believes that [defendant] can be forbidden to use the trade name for her hairdressing store at the [Pand2] because at the time [defendant] started that hairdresser's shop, [plaintiff] already used the trade name in Leiden.For the assessment of the claim of [plaintiff], it is therefore about the older company of [plaintiff] to the [Pand1] ("one") in relation to the younger company of [defendant] to the [Pand2] ("Theother ").That the later use of the trade name for the hairdressing store of [defendant] at the [Pand2] danger of confusion with the public between those hairdressing affairs has arisen (and therefore met the condition under 3)), as above under 5.1already said - not in dispute.This means that the appeal of [plaintiff] to Article 5 of the HNW can succeed if [plaintiff] started to lawfully conduct the trade name after the takeover of the hairdresser's shop on 29 February 2020 (as referred to in the condition mentioned under 1)in the test of Article 5 HNW).
5.5.
In the view of [defendant], [plaintiff] did not have the right to continue to use the trade name after the takeover, so that condition 1).She actually put forward two reasons for this.The first reason is that the trade name already belonged to the VOF and [plaintiff] would not have received permission from the VOF to (continue to) use the trade name.However, the fact that there was someone else who used the trade name before [plaintiff] decided to retain the trade name for the hairdressing store after the takeover, however, does not mean that this was unlawful.This requires that [plaintiff] has infringed the rights of the VOF with the continued use of the trade name.The preliminary relief judge therefore understands this argument in such a way that [defendant] believes that [plaintiff] acts contrary to Article 5 HNW or infringes the VOF brand by continuing to carry the trade name for her hairdressing business.The second reason is that it would have been agreed with [plaintiff] that she would choose a different trade name for the hairdressing store at the [Pand1].For these two reasons, [defendant] believes that [plaintiff] cannot prohibit her from using the trade name for her hairdressing store at the [Pand2].
5.6.
With the appeal to Article 5 of the HNW, [defendant] does not only oppose the prohibition claimed by [plaintiff], but she believes the other way around that a prohibition for [plaintiff] is appropriate.Since [defendant], because of the stipulated older rights of the VOF, invokes the trade name on this article to prevent [plaintiff] to prevent the use of the trade name, the claim of [defendant] is therefore the older VOF (“the one") Compared to the younger company of [plaintiff] on the [Pand1] (" the other ").A successful appeal by [defendant] on Article 5 of the HNW therefore requires that the use of [plaintiff] after the acquisition has caused a risk of confusion with the public between the hairdresser's shop of [plaintiff] and the hairdressing affairs of the VOF (according tothe condition mentioned under 3).The fact that the VOF already lawfully conducted the trade name for hairdressing affairs before [plaintiff] took over the hairdressing store at the [Pand1] does not seem like a point of discussion.
5.7.If [plaintiff] in violation of the stated rights of the VOF on the trade name that name has continued to use for her hairdresser's case at the [Pand1], the prohibition demanded by herself must be rejected (because she did not lawfully commit the trade name; the defense of[defendant] against the claim of [plaintiff] in the convention) and the prohibition claimed by [defendant] can be granted (because her appeal to Article 5 HNW succeeds in the counterclaim).However, the preliminary relief judge is of the opinion that at the moment no infringement by [plaintiff] on the rights of the VOF can be assumed.The reason for this is as follows.
Is the use of the trade name by [plaintiff] in violation of the right of the VOF to the trade name?
5.8.
It must be stated that [defendant] appeals to the older Rights of the VOF in its own name and not on behalf of the VOF.[defendant] has submitted a statement of (the partners of) the VOF, but it states that the VOF will soon start a lawsuit against [plaintiff].
5.9.
Provided as an interested party, a person other than the person to whom the older trade name "belongs" can also appeal to Article 5 of HNW.Assuming that [defendant] is indeed such an interested party, she can therefore stand up by [plaintiff] with a reference to the trade name of the VOF against the use of the trade name.As mentioned above, a successful appeal by [defendant] on Article 5 of the HNW requires that due to the use of [plaintiff] after the takeover on 29 February 2020, there is a risk of confusion with the public between the hairdresser's business of [plaintiff] and the hairdresser's affairsVan de VOF was created (according to the condition mentioned under 3).In the opinion of the preliminary relief judge, however, the debate conducted between [plaintiff] and [defendant] cannot form a sufficient basis for the conclusion that this condition is met.
5.10.
Although [defendant] has pointed out that the VOF is a 'national chain' and that the trade name has been conducted by the VOF since the early 2000s, which apparently means that the trade name is known in (whole) Netherlands and therefore also withSuccess can be made against the use of that trade name in Leiden, but this is not further worked out or substantiated.It is clear (according to it its internet address www.kapsalonpromise.nl linked website, which website the preliminary relief judge has viewed during the oral hearing with parties) that the VOF uses the trade name for multiple branches of hairdressing affairs in the Netherlands, but those branches are actually all located themselvesin the north of the Netherlands.After the takeover by [plaintiff] of the barber shop in the [Pand1], the VOF no longer had a branch in Leiden.The preliminary relief judge does not automatically see that De VOF is a national chain with fame throughout the country, whose trade name can therefore be deemed to have in Leiden.Now that it is not possible for that reason to be assumed that the condition of a danger of confusing is met, the appeal of [defendant] to Article 5 of the HNW in these procedure cannot succeed.
5.11.
Because [defendant] is not a holder of the VOF brand (see rov. 3.11), she cannot appeal to this brand by [plaintiff] without the VOF process of the VOF.Whether the use of the trade name is contrary to the brand is therefore a question that cannot be answered in this procedure.For that reason, the brand cannot play a role in the question to be answered in these summary proceedings whether [plaintiff] or [defendant] should stop using the trade name.
5.12.
This means that the appeal of [defendant] on Article 5 of the HNW, both mentioned and a defense against the prohibition demanded by [plaintiff] as the basis for the prohibition advanced by herself, is not affected.The question that remains is whether it has been agreed with [plaintiff] that she would choose a different trade name for the hairdressing store at the [Pand1].As it will be explained below, it justifies that what is now known about the agreements made at the takeover not the conclusion that it was agreed that [plaintiff] would change the trade name for the hairdresser's shop at the [Pand1].
Has it been agreed at the acquisition that [plaintiff] would choose a different trade name?
5.13.The fact that the agreement would have been made that [plaintiff] would choose a different trade name cannot be deduced from the written written agreements about the acquisition of the hairdressing store at the [Pand1].The handwritten contract (see rov. 3.3) determines no more than that there is a "acquisition of Kapsalon Promise" and at what price that takeover takes place.According to the special provision in the lease that has also been signed by [defendant] (see rov. 3.4), [plaintiff] can be regarded as "business successor".If it is correct, as [defendant] states that it was explicitly agreed with [plaintiff] that she would take over the hairdresser's shop at the [Pand1] but would look for a different name, then it would have been obvious oneinclude such an agreement in the contract.However, a specific condition for continuing the hairdressing store to the [Pand1] under a different name after this takeover is not part of the written agreements submitted in these procedure.
5.14.
Also, the WhatsApp interviews conducted with [plaintiff] with [plaintiff] with [plaintiff] with [plaintiff] (see rov. 3.5) also shows nothing of a special appointment about the trade name.Although those messages have been submitted by [plaintiff], and not by [defendant] to substantiate her statement of express agreements about the trade name, but according to [defendant] it is about conversations with the old owner, who would be a family member of theDnuten of the VOF, and would have something to say about the use of the trade name.If that is already correct, he does not mention a word in these conversations about changing the trade name by [plaintiff].In those conversations it is only about practical matters, such as the deposit for the rented building on the [Pand1], the keys to the building and still to be picked up.
5.15.
In the WhatsApp interviews of November 2020, as submitted by [defendant] (see rov. 3.8), it is (for the first time) talking about changing the trade name by [plaintiff].It also seems that this is also about conversations from [plaintiff] with the old owner, since a number of messages with the name [X] are concluded.But these conversations cannot, in the provisional judgment, also show that it was explicitly agreed during the takeover that [plaintiff] would change the trade name for the hairdressing store at the [Pand1].After all, the fact that [plaintiff], if [defendant] has already started the hairdresser's shop at the [Pand2], is requested to switch to another trade name, does not mean that that request is made because there are agreements about them.It is only clear that [plaintiff] is addressed (still) that that trade name is addressed for her hairdresser's shop at the [Pand1].One reason why she should change the name for her hairdressing store is not mentioned.In this way, the reactions of [plaintiff] to those messages ("we are busy" and "ok") cannot be interpreted as a recognition of existing agreements about the trade name or a recognition that [plaintiff] would be obliged to name the namechange.
5.16.
The preliminary judgment of the preliminary relief judge is therefore that none of the reasons that [defendant] has argued to argue that [plaintiff] can not be lawful after the takeover of the hairdresser's case at the [Pand1].
The advanced forbidden
5.17.
All the foregoing means that it must be assumed for the time being that [plaintiff] has lawfully used the trade name since 29 February 2020 for its hairdresser's shop to the [Pand1] in Leiden (and therefore met the condition mentioned earlier under 1)of Article 5 HNW).Because [defendant] started to use the trade name later for its hairdressing store at the [Pand2] than [plaintiff] for her hairdressing store at the [Pand1] and thereby arising from confusion, [plaintiff] can successfully successfully based on Article 5 HNWoppose the use of the trade name for that hairdressing store.This means that the prohibition on the primary basis will be allocated by [plaintiff].The preliminary relief judge no longer belongs to the subsidiary basis, which means that it is not necessary to see whether there is another reason to allocate the prohibition claimed by [plaintiff].
5.18.
The prohibition to be imposed on [defendant] to be imposed on [defendant] will be attached, as demanded by [plaintiff], as an incentive to fulfill the prohibition to be imposed by [defendant].
5.19.As long as it is not successfully appealed to use by [plaintiff] of the trade name in violation of the rights of the VOF or to existing agreements on the use of the trade name by [plaintiff], there is no reason [plaintiff] the use of the trade namefor her hairdressing store at the [Pand1] in Leiden.The prohibition claimed by [defendant] in the counterclaim will therefore be rejected, both on the primary basis of infringement on Article 5 of HNW and the subsidiary basis of unlawful acts, for which both bases the same has been argued.

[defendant] will be ordered both in the convention and counterclaim and the unsuccessful party to the costs of the proceedings of [plaintiff].The remark of [plaintiff] about the costs of the proceedings of [defendant] (see rov. 2.2.3) can therefore remain undiscussed.
5.21.
[plaintiff] is entitled to the reimbursement of the reasonable and proportional costs as referred to in Article 1019h DCCP.[plaintiff] has submitted a specification of the amount of the costs of her lawyer that adds up to an amount of € 14,625 excluding VAT for this whole case.
5.22.
In order to be able to assess the reasonableness and proportionality of the specified costs, the preliminary relief judge is in line with the so-called Indication rates in IP Affairs (version April 2017) that can be consulted via www.rechtspraak.nl.These indication rates indicate a maximum rate per category of lawyer costs per category of case and serve as a directive for assessing the claimed costs of the proceedings.The rates stated in the indicator rates are deemed to be reasonable and proportional.
5.23.
The preliminary relief judge is of the opinion that the procedure in the convention and counterclaim is entirely together, because the reason for allocating the counterclaim of the prohibition on [defendant] at the same time is at the same time the reason why the conventional prohibition should be rejected, and alsoThe defense of [plaintiff] against the counterclaimal claim is the same as the reason for claiming a prohibition against [defendant].The rate to be applied according to the indication rates therefore therefore applies to the convention and the counterclaim together, whereby the entire rate will be allocated to the convention and the costs in counterclaim will be set at nil.
5.24.
In the opinion of the preliminary relief judge, the present case falls under the Easy Surface Case category with a maximum rate of € 6,000.For this purpose it is important, among other things, that the extent of the facts investigation for this procedure and the extent of the relevant complex of facts is clear, the foundations are limited and the extent of the defenses and the file can be clearly defined and good.This means that of the amount claimed of € 14,625, an amount of € 6,000 in lawyer fees for this case can be regarded as reasonable and proportional and can therefore not be eligible for reimbursement for reimbursement.
5.25.
That amount relates to both the primary basis of the claims of enforcement of an intellectual property law (here: a trade name law) (the so-called IE part of this procedure) and on the subsidiary basis of an unlawful act (the Niet IE part).The costs of the non-part of the claims fall outside the scope of Article 1019h of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure and must therefore be estimated on the basis of Article 237 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure.The present case largely concerns the enforcement of intellectual property rights and is only a small part based on an unlawful act, for which no additional facts have been created in relation to the IP part of this procedure.The court therefore estimates that the IP part has been spent 95% of the time and 5% on the unlawful act basis.
5.26.
This means that [defendant] will be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings on the part of [plaintiff] for an amount of 95% x € 6,000 for the IE part, or
€ 5,700, whereby an amount of € 50.80 will be added for the not IE part
(€ 1,016,-
3
x 5%), and what will still be increased by an amount of € 309,- paid by [plaintiff] for court fees and an amount of € 87.61 to its bailiff costs.The total amount then amounts to € 6,147.41.[Defendant] will be ordered in the counterclaim for the costs of the proceedings on the part of [plaintiff], to be set to nil.
Deadline of Article 1019i of the Rv
5.27.
The preliminary relief judge will set the period as referred to in Article 1019i of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure on six months after the date of this judgment.
