Pronunciation
Court [Central Netherlands
Seat in Utrecht
Administrative law
Case number: Utr 22/4968
ruling of the single chamber of 22 February 2023 in the case between
[plaintiff], in [place of residence], plaintiff,
(authorized representative: A. Hashem Jawaheri),
and
The Board of Directors of the Employee Insurance Implementation Institute,
defendant.
Process
This decision is about the claimant's appeal against the defendant's decision of
October 14, 2022.
Consideration
1. The court does not invite the parties to a hearing, because this is not necessary in this case.The plaintiff did not pay the court fees, so that the court cannot deal with the case substantively.The court will explain that further below.
2. Someone who appeals must pay court fees.This is stated in Article 8:41, first paragraph, of the General Administrative Law Act (Awb).In this case, the court fees are â‚¬ 50.
3. If the court fees are not paid, the main rule is that the court may not handle the appeal substantively.Sometimes it is different.Then there is a valid reason why the court fees were not received by the court.This concerns circumstances that the plaintiff cannot do anything about.
4. On November 26, 2022, the court sent the plaintiff a registered letter, stating that the plaintiff must pay the court fee to the court within four weeks.
5. The court did not receive the amount.Plaintiff has not given a valid reason for that.
6. The appeal will not be dealt with substantively and the court will not make a decision about the appeal.The profession is apparently inadmissible (Article 8:54 Awb).
7. There is no reason for a reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings.

This statement was made by R.C.Stijnen, Judge, in the presence of S. Ayyildiz, clerk.The decision was pronounced in public on February 22, 2022.
