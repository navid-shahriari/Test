1.
The course of the procedure
The subdistrict court judge has taken note of the following procedural documents:
- the petition with productions, received on 3 June 2021,
- The statement of defense with productions, also independent counter -request.
The oral treatment took place on July 13, 2021.
The decision of the decision was determined today on today.
2.
The facts
2.1.
[person A] joined [VOF B] on 1 March 2019, who operates a snack bar.
2.2.
The salary of [person A] was recently € 1,758.22 net per month.
2.3.
[person A] left for Iran on 6 May 2021 in connection with the death of his grandfather.He booked the return flight on May 20, 2021.
2.4.
[VOF B] dismissed [person A] on May 14, 2021 by WhatsApp immediately as of May 12, 2021. [Person A] then stayed in Iran.[VOF B] confirmed the dismissal by letter of 17 May 2021 to [person A].
2.5.
The letter of 17 May 2021 reads, among other things:
"As indicated on 14 May per WhatsApp message, we would like to officially announce you by letter that you were immediately dismissed on 12 May.
You are known for the reason for this.However, we will list it again for you;
You indicated on Tuesday 4 May that your grandfather has died and that you must travel to Iran for his funeral.We have condolenced you and indicated that you will have the opportunity from us to say goodbye to your grandfather until Wednesday 12 May.We have made this known to you both by telephone and via WhatsApp.We have given you for quite some time outside the regular two days before the death of a second -degree family member, because we have taken into account that before you leave and travel back, you have to take a PCR test and that you also have the time to have time with yourfamily.You have sent us a document from your travel ticket.This contained a outward journey of May 6 with a return trip of 20 May.
In the first instance we asked you why you need the time until 20 May.You have indicated that you will get married in addition to the funeral of your grandfather.Given the Corona conditions, given the staff shortage, given the point that you also went to Iran for almost 1 month last year without our approval for leave and the point that we are closed every year in the summer holidays and every colleague of ours thenWe have not accepted the possibility of vacation from 20 May.We have clearly indicated that this is not the first time that you suddenly and without consent enforce leave and that you are 4 weeks off during the summer holidays.Finally, we have indicated if you do not come to work on Wednesday 12 May, we will dismiss you with immediate effect, there this disrupted our work.
On Wednesday 12 May you did not appear at work and you did not contact us in any way.On Friday, May 14, we announced you per WhatsApp that you were fired with immediate effect. "

The requests
The request of [person A]
requests [VOF B] to order to pay € 1,260.00 in transition payment, € 1,758.22 in cancellation period and € 5,000.00 in fair compensation, all with interest, with a net/gross specification on penalty of apenalty.Furthermore, [person A] requests [VOF B] to order to pay the extrajudicial collection costs and the costs of the proceedings with interest and follow -up costs.
The counter request of [VOF B]
requests that [person A] order to pay € 5,000.00 in compensation and cost reimbursement, with interest and with the provision of a net/gross specification on pain of a penalty.Furthermore, [VOF B] requests that [person A] order to pay the extrajudicial collection costs and the costs of the proceedings with interest and follow -up costs.
4.
The assessment
With regard to the request of [person A]4.1.
In this case it is first and foremost the question of whether [person A] was rightly dismissed on 12 May 2021.If this question is to be answered in the negative, the question is then discussed whether [person A] is charged to [VOF B] the requested reimbursements.
4.2.
First of all, it can be established that [person A] submitted his request in time, because it was received within two months of the day on which the employment contract ended.
4.3.
[VOF B] has the urgent reason for
the immediate dismissal
stated that [person A] has extended his special leave against her explicit instruction and without her permission until May 20, 2021 and therefore did not resume his work on May 12, 2021, while [person A] explicitly before his departure to Iran for thatcase with immediate dismissal was announced.In addition, [VOF B] took into account that [person A] has previously taken leave without its approval.
4.4.
[person A] stated in more detail at the hearing that in the course of 2021 he received permission from [VOF B] to take two weeks of vacation in May in connection with his intention to get married.[VOF B] disputes this.She states that although it has been discussed the possibility that [person A] would take vacation days earlier than during the summer holidays if his divorce would be final and he would get married again, but because things still have uncertain factors depended onNo concrete agreements have been made about this.Proof of the permission set by [person A] is not ahead.Thus it cannot be established in law that [person A] had permission in advance to take two weeks of vacation in May 2021.
4.5.
On May 4, 2021, [person A] informed [person B2] that he intended to leave for Iran in connection with the death of his grandfather that day.According to [person A], [person B2] was aware that he wanted to go to Iran for two weeks, but according to [person B2], the duration of the leave was not yet discussed.It is established between the parties that on 5 May 2021 [person B1] contacted [person A] with the announcement that the leave would apply until 12 May 2021 and that [person A] then copy from his flight ticket to [VOF B that same day, the same day] sent on which the return date was stated on May 20, 2021.It is also certain that [person A] then asked [VOF B] if she had connections with Turkish Airlines to change the return date, to which the answer was negative.According to [person B2], he advised [person A] to change the return date before his departure on 6 May 2021 at Schiphol.In any case, it is certain that [person A] knew on May 5, 2021 that he had no permission to return from leave later than on 12 May 2021.
4.6.
Subsequently, the question was whether [person A] was told on 5 May 2021 that if he would not resume his work on 12 May 2021, he would be fired with immediate effect.[VOF B] states that this was explicitly said.During the oral treatment, [person A] initially stated "if I would not be back by that date, then dismissal", but he later returned to it with the statement that on May 5, 2021 was not discussed.Proof that dismissal has been announced in advance is not ahead so that this has not been established.
4.7.
Nor is there evidence for the statement of [VOF B] that [person A] took leave without her permission earlier during the employment, let alone that an official warning was given to him for this.
4.8.
So the factual complex shown under 4.5, which is in itself, is insufficient to justify an immediate dismissal.Although [person A] can be blamed for knowingly and knowingly against the express instruction of [VOF B] his leave is not limited to 12 May 2021 while that was possible if he himself had cared for his return flight, [VOF hadB] can suffice with a less radical measure such as a wage sanction.
4.9.
It is therefore concluded that there is no legally valid dismissal immediate dismissal, so that it has been terminated in violation of Article 7: 671 of the Dutch Civil Code in combination with Article 7: 677 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code.
4.10.
Subsequently, the question arises to what extent [person A] is charged to [VOF B] the requested reimbursements.
4.11.
Pursuant to Article 7: 673, paragraph 1a under 1 of the Dutch Civil Code, [VOF B] is to [person A] a
transition payment
due, now that the employment contract has been canceled by [VOF B].[person A] has calculated this on € 1,260.00 gross, so that this amount will be allocated.
4.12.
Furthermore, [person A] requests a reimbursement for a month's notice period, which will be intended
the fixed compensation for irregular cancellationof the employment contract, which according to Article 7: 672 paragraph 11 of the Dutch Civil Code is equal to the amount of the wage for the period that the employment contract had to be taken in a regular cancellation.[person A] has calculated this reimbursement on his net monthly wage of
€ 1,758.22, which amount will be allocated.
4.13.
[person A] also ask one
fair compensation
, apparently on the basis of Article 7: 681, paragraph 1a of the Dutch Civil Code.The legal basis for the granting of a fair compensation is in principle given with the opinion that there is no urgent reason for the immediate dismissal and that has been canceled in violation of Article 7: 671 of the Dutch Civil Code (see: Parliamentary Papers I, 2013-2014,33 818, no. C, pages 99 and 113).This means that the granting of fair compensation is appropriate.When determining the extent of that compensation, it comes to an assessment of all circumstances of the case and the judge must provide insight into the circumstances that have led to the amount of the compensation in the reasons for his opinion (See: HR 30 June 2017, ECLI: NL: HR: 2017: 1187, New Hairstyle).
4.14.
Although [VOF B] has incorrectly proceeded with the dismissal, [person A] blames him that he knowingly and knowingly against the express instruction of [VOF B] has not limited his leave to 12 May 2021 while that was possibleIf he himself had cared for a change in his return flight.The leave given by [VOF B] from eight days before the death of [person A ]'s grandfather is, also taking into account the related journey to Iran, in any case reasonable.[VOF B] has made it sufficiently plausible that a longer leave was too stressful for her in connection with the occupation of the snack bar where only a few people work.By letting his travel plan adjust to this and on 12 May 2021 the work against the instruction in not resuming, [person A] called the risk that [VOF B] would take measures against him.With regard to the financial consequences of the dismissal for [person A], the subdistrict court judge takes into account that he can in principle appeal to unemployment benefits or will be able to find similar work in the hospitality sector, and thatHe is offered sufficient compensation with the assignment of the transition payment and the fixed compensation.In view of all these circumstances, reason is seen to determine the fair compensation for nil.
4.15.
In application of Article 7: 686a (1), the claimed statutory interest on the transition payment will be allocated from 12 June 2021 and on the fixed compensation from 12 May 2021. The claim for gross/net specifications is moderation of the penalty,assigned.
4.16.
The claim for reimbursement of extrajudicial collection costs is rejected in the absence of any substantiation.
With regard to the counter request of [VOF B]
4.17.
The assessment and outcome of the request of [person A] with regard to the immediate dismissal means that the counter -request from [VOF B] is missing basis, so that this is rejected.
With regard to the costs of the proceedings
4.18.
Because the parties are partly in the same and uneven, the costs of the proceedings with regard to mutual requests are compensated so that each party bears its own costs.
5.

With regard to the request of [person A]:
