4
The size of the dispute
4.1
In the case of the contested decision, insofar as relevant here, with amending the decision of the Gelderland District Court of 27 January 2021, the child support to be paid by the man to the woman with effect from 18 March 2022 is set at € 365 per monthFor [the minor] and € 431 per month for [defendant2].From the date of the contested decision, child support must always be paid in advance.The decision is declared enforceable in stock.

5
The reasons for the decision
consultation of documents
5.1
The Court of Appeal, with reference to the two-conclusion rule, decided on the oral hearing that this will be disregarded with regard to the Journal Report of Mr. Hashem Jawaheri of 12 June 2023 on 12 June 2023.
Pursuant to Article 347 (1) of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure in connection with Article 362 DCCP, the so-called two-conclusion rule applies on appeal.This means that the parties must set their position in one written document.The proposal of new positions (increase or change of requests or defenses) in further documents, even if this is in response to a document submitted by another party, is in principle no longer possible and this case does not show a legitimate exceptionon that.
substantive assessment
5.2
[Defendant2] turned eighteen on 12 September 2022.From that date, the contribution to the woman to be paid to the woman to the costs of care and upbringing of [defendant2], on the basis of Article 1: 395b of the Dutch Civil Code (further: BW), has been legally converted into a contribution to the costsof his livelihood and study.When assessing the dispute on the contribution for [defendant2], the Court of Appeal therefore assumes two periods that can be distinguished, namely the period up to 12 September 2022 and the period from 12 September 2022.
(Non-) Repair
5.3The court determined the commencement date of the amended child support on 18 March 2022. In an incidental appeal, [defendant2] has directed a complaint against the effective date of the amended child support by the court.[Defendant2] requests the Court of Appeal to determine the commencement date of the amended contribution at an earlier time, namely October 1, 2021. In the period from 1 October 2021 to 18 March 2022, however, [defendant2] was still a minor, so that the Court of Appeal was not [defendant2]-Incomprehensible in his request in an incidental appeal.
5.4
Contrary to what the man says, the woman is admissible in her request with regard to child support for [defendant2] in the period before 12 September 2021. The woman is the beneficiary of the contribution to the costs of care and upbringing of [defendant2] to theday on which [defendant2] has become of age and continues to litigate after the adult of [defendant2] to litigate on the maintenance contribution due to that day.
starting date
5.5
The woman does not agree with the effective date of the amended child support by the court.The woman requests the effective date of the change to determine at an earlier time, namely October 1, 2021. According to the woman, the man was requested by e-mail of 19 August 2021 for a higher contribution because the man no longer has double housing costs from 1 October 2021has.By e-mail of 24 August 2021, the man's lawyer announced that the loss of double housing costs indeed justifies a recalculation.From that moment on, the man should have taken into account that he owes a higher contribution for the children on 1 October 2021, according to the woman.
The man in turn states that the e-mail to which the woman refers show that much was still unclear, so that the man could not deduce that he owed a higher contribution from 1 October 2021.
5.6
The court considers as follows.Article 1: 402 of the Dutch Civil Code leaves the court great freedom when determining the effective date of the alimony obligation.Three dates are the most obvious as an effective date: the date on which the circumstances occur that are decisive for the maintenance obligation, the date of the introductory procedural document and the date on which the court decides.The judge who decides on a request for amending a previously determined contribution to the livelihood will generally have to make the change of his authority to make the change to a date before his decision.
In what the woman has put forward, the Court sees no reason to determine the effective date of the amended child support at a different time.The e-mails to which the woman refers show that the man has agreed to make a new calculation.The financial data of the woman must also be involved in that new calculation.However, these were not known to the man.In view of this uncertainty, it was therefore not clear to the man at that time what his contribution would be, so that he could not be expected to take that into account.
The Court of Appeal will therefore confirm the contested decision with regard to the commencement date of the amended contribution.
need [the minor]
5.7
There is no dispute between the man and the woman that the need of [the minor] is € 662 per month.
need [defendant2]
5.8
The man takes the position that the need of [defendant2] should be determined on the basis of the WSF standard for a student at MBO level 3 and 4, and according to the man it is € 643.74.
In addition, the man states that from March 22, 2021, [defendant2] does not need a contribution to the costs of care and upbringing.[defendant2] does not study and has its own business.The income from the company is such that [defendant2] can meet his own need, so that he does not need a contribution, according to the man.
5.9
Based on the alimony formulated alimony standards formulated (further: the alimony standards), for the needs of a young man, in general, a connection can be sought with the standard amount for the costs of living from the WSF standard.Also for non-studying young people from young people can be affiliated with the WSF standard, with deduction of the study costs (books and learning resources) contained therein.
period until September 12, 2022
5.10Until 12 September 2022, [defendant2] was still a minor.The Court of Appeal sees no reason to determine the needs of [defendant2] in the period in which he was still a minor, on the basis of the WSF standard.In addition, the child's own income does not reduce the need during minority.With regard to the needs of [defendant2] until 12 September 2022, the Court of Appeal will therefore start from the needs of € 662 set by the court per month.
Period from September 12, 2022
5.11
[Defendant2] argues that there was no discussion in the first instance about the amount of the need, so that the needs of € 662 determined by the court must be based on.In addition, [defendant2] argues that he indeed no longer studies and has his own company, but that the turnover of the company is not such that he can meet his own needs.After all, a company also includes costs and the costs are not from the documents submitted by the man, according to [defendant2].
5.12
The court considers as follows.Pursuant to Article 1: 392 of the Dutch Civil Code, in connection with Article 1: 395a of the Dutch Civil Code, the maintenance obligation of parents applies to their young -time -old children regardless of their need.In other words, young people from young people (between the ages of eighteen to twenty -one) cannot be set that they must provide for their own maintenance.No obligation to use his or her earning capacity on the young person's anniversary, nor the obligation to use (existing) possibilities through a (by) job to gain their own income.That does not mean that the own income of De Jongiweerderden cannot affect the alimony.After all, this income is important for the extent of the needs of the young man to a maintenance contribution.According to the alimony standards, structural own income of a young person can lower the needs.
5.13
Until the eighteenth birthday of [defendant2], the man had insight into the bank account of [defendant2].The copies of this bank account submitted by the man show that significant amounts were earned in the company of [defendant2].This is not disputed.It has also not been shown that this has become or has stopped since he was eighteen.
[Defendant2] states that there is also costs for a company and that the turnover of the company is not evident from the documents submitted by the man.[defendant2], however, has failed to put the documents in which the costs and the turnover would prove.Despite requests from the man to inform him about the income of [defendant2], [defendant2] did not do this.With the man, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that this is for the account and risk of [defendant2], so that the Court of Appeal will assume the bank statements submitted by the man and the income to be deducted from it.In view of the amount of this income and because they are structural, the Court will deduct it from the needs of [defendant2].
This means that even if the needs of [defendant2] set by the court should be affiliated (what the man disputes), [defendant2] no longer has an additional need for a contribution to the costs of his living and study.
5.14
If [defendant2] would start studying again and/or will enjoy no or less income, the man may again have to pay a contribution to the costs of her livelihood and study.
5.15
Now that [defendant2], in the opinion of the Court from 12 September 2022, no longer needs a contribution to the costs of his livelihood and study, the Court will set this contribution to zero from 12 September 2022.As a result, the man no longer has an interest in his request to order [defendant2] all the documents that relate to his company must be at stake, so that the Court will reject that request of the man.
distribution of the children's costs
5.16
Both parents should contribute to the needs of the children in proportion to their capacity.The Court will attach to the man and the woman to be made to this decision below.
capacity man
5.17
The man does not agree with his capacity determined by the court.According to the man, a joint debt with [name1] must be taken into account when determining his capacity for which he repays € 120 per month.
The woman in turn argues that she does not acknowledge the debt and that any debt can be repaid from savings or other assets.
5.18The court considers as follows.Although the man has submitted a letter from [name1] of 1 March 2022 at first instance, this shows insufficiently about the nature of the debt for which it has been entered into, whether it concerns a joint debt or whether actual repayments are made on thatdebt.It is therefore unclear to the Court of Appeal, partly in view of the dispute by the woman, whether this concerns a non-removable and/or non-avoidable debt that must be taken into account when determining his capacity.When determining the man's capacity of the man, the Court will therefore not take this debt into account and the monthly repayment thereof.The Court is based on the capacity determined by the court of € 1,154 per month
capacity
5.19
The man states that when determining the wife's capacity, no account was not taken of the income of the woman's company, the individual choice budget (hereinafter: IKB) that the woman receives and the interest income of the bank accountsIn Iran.
Income from business
5.20
During the oral hearing, the woman announced that she has registered a company in the Chamber of Commerce, but that she does not perform any activities with this company.The woman is planning to start her own business, but this has not yet got off the ground.At the moment she does not receive any income from the company, according to the woman.
5.21
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the man failed to sufficiently substantiate his position, opposite the motivated dispute of the woman.Now that the necessary substantiation is lacking, the existence of a company from which the woman generates income is not established.The Court of Appeal will therefore reject the man's request to order the woman all documents regarding her income and results from business.
Individual choice budget (IKB)
5.22
The man states that the court wrongly did not take the IKB.It follows from the salary strip of April 2021 that there has been a payment of this budget to the woman for which payroll tax has been withheld, according to the man.
The woman in turn argues that the man does not motivate why he comes to a different position than the court and that the IKB cannot be taken into her gross income.
5.23
The court considers as follows.As the court has considered, the IKB is a budget that usually consists of various components such as: holiday allowance, end -of -year bonus, life -course contribution and converted extra leave.The budget is a percentage of the salary and is built every month.The employee can more or less have this budget.Part of the budget can be used for, for example, extra days off, training, extra pension or the budget can be paid out as an extra wage.Budget that was not spent during the year will be paid in December of that year.
The woman has not stated that she spends her IKB on the benefit of other purposes, so that the Court assumes that it will be paid.When determining its capacity, the Court of Appeal will therefore take into account an IKB of € 611 per month.Because the holiday allowance is included in the IKB, the Court, unlike the court, does not take the holiday allowance into account separately.
Interest income Bank accounts Iran
5.24
The man states that the woman receives interest income from bank accounts in Iran that must be taken into account when determining her capacity.According to the man, the interest in Iran is currently 18% and the woman has a considerable amount on her accounts in Iran in view of the sale of a home in Iran.
The woman denies this and says with the submission of income tax to have given access to her income.All income is included, according to the woman.
5.25
The man has not substantiated his position with any piece.In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the man has therefore failed to sufficiently substantiate his statement against the reasoned dispute of the woman.Now that the necessary substantiation is missing, the existence of interest income on bank accounts in Iran has not been established.
5.26
In view of the foregoing, the Court will make a new capacity calculation for women.The Court of Appeal is in line with the legal standards.The Court of Appeal will therefore, unlike the court, take into account the child -related budget that the woman receives for [the minor].
5.27
With due observance of the foregoing it follows from the attached calculation that the net disposable income of the woman is € 3,065 per month.Her capacity is then € 788 per month.
capacity comparison
5.28
The total capacity of the man and the woman (1,154 + 788) is € 1,942 per month.The needs of the children is set at (662 + 662) € 1,324 per month.Based on the foregoing:
-the man's share (1,154/1,942 x 1,324) € 787 per month;
-
The share of the woman (788/1,942 x 1,324) € 537 per month.
reduction with the care discount
5.29
The care discount of 5% used by the court for [defendant2] is not in dispute.
5.30
The woman does not agree with the percentage of care discount of 15%used by the court for [the minor].The woman takes the position that the care discount applied by the court is not in proportion to care provided by the man.The man sees [the minor] at the moment two hours every two weeks and it is not to be expected that this will be more in the short term, according to the woman.
The man in turn argues that he incurs various costs to see [the minor].For example, he incurs something to eat something together with [the minor], he has travel costs and takes free hours.
5.31
The court considers as follows.The costs of the distribution of care are taken into account as a percentage of the need, the care discount.The percentage of the care discount depends on the frequency of care.
For shared care for less than one day a week as is the case here, a care discount of 5%fits on the basis of the alimony standards.In what the man has put forward, the Court sees no reason to deviate from it.In addition, the Court of Appeal has established in the case with number 200.321.197 that the current care scheme is not appropriate for [the minor].To give [the minor] the opportunity to think about how the contact between him and the man can be shaped in a manner that is suitable for him, the Court of Appeal has temporarily suspended the current care scheme.
Because the parents and their child have the right and obligation to handle intercourse and at least up to that amount could be foreseen in healthcare, the care discount on the basis of the alimony standards is at least 5% of the need.Now that the man is willing to comply with his obligation in this context, the Court sees no reason to deviate from it, so that the Court will also assume a care discount of 5%for [the minor].
5.32
Now that the parents, as maintenance payers, have sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the children, the amount of the care discount is fully deducted from the amount that the man must pay to the woman for the costs of care and upbringing.
5.33
It follows from the attached capacity calculation that the man must pay € 721 per month after deduction of the care discount as a contribution to the costs of care and upbringing of the children.
reimbursement obligation
5.34
During the oral treatment it turned out that the man has a backlog in the payments and that the woman has taken execution measures.Insofar as the man has paid more or has recovered from him, that is unduly and the woman and [defendant2] must repay what they have received too much.That can be required of them now that it has been found that the wife's capacity is higher than calculated by the court and in addition [defendant2], in any case from 12 September 2022, has their own income.
proceedings
5.35
The Court of Appeal will compensate for the costs of the proceedings in the cases with numbers 200.321.200 and 200.323.419-01, now that the man and the wife are former spouses and the procedure concerns the contribution to the children born during that relationship.
5.36
The Court will compensate the costs of the proceedings in the cases with numbers 200.321.200 and 200.323.419-01 on appeal.The court will also compensate for the costs in the case with number 200.323.437-01.Procedure compensation means that everyone pays their own costs.
In family matters this is common because it often concerns matters between former spouses who have a dispute about the contributions for their children (such as here in the first two things) or between parents and (young adult) children about a contribution to the costsof study and living (as in the third case).The Court has no reason to deviate from that rule.
