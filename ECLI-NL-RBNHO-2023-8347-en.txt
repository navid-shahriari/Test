The case in short
2.1.
[plaintiff] was offered in the judgment of 6 June 2023 to stop the procedures in Iran, concerning a dowry of 314 gold coins and stopped, on pain of a penalty.[Defendant] has ordered the execution of the judgment.[plaintiff] takes the position that there are no procedures in Iran on the dowry and did not run after 6 June 2023.According to [plaintiff], there were therefore wrongly attached to the bank and on her car.It claims the cancellation of those attachments.[plaintiff] also wants the execution of the judgment of 6 June 2023 to be suspended, because that judgment is based on a legal or factual missing impact due to a wrong interpretation of her defense at the hearing.[Defendant] takes abuse of authority by executing the judgment.
2.2.
The preliminary relief judge finds that the attachment has been set unlawfully, because it has not been sufficiently plausible that penalty payments have been forfeited.As a result, the attachments made of [plaintiff] must be lifted.Intrequently enforcement of the judgment of 6 June 2023 also provides abuse of rights in the given circumstances.That is why the execution of the judgment is suspended.

Facts
3.1.
Parties have been married.The marriage ended in 2018 by registration of the divorce decision in the designated registers.
3.2.
In the marriage certificate, the parties have agreed a bridal gift of (among others) 314 'Bahar Azadi Gold Coins'.By order of 26 May 2020, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal determined that [defendant] owes the bridal gift to [plaintiff].
3.3.
[plaintiff] also started a procedure against [defendant] in Iran.The family court of the city of Kashan ruled by judgment of 1 February 2023 that the bridal gift has already been paid by [defendant] and there is no more debt of him to [plaintiff].
3.4.
[plaintiff] appealed against the decision of 1 February 2023.The decision on appeal of 18 April 2023 has not led to another decision.
3.5.
On May 4, 2023, [defendant] brought in summary proceedings in the Netherlands.In that procedure, [defendant] claimed to argue [plaintiff] to stop and stop the procedures about the dowry, or about any case, and to hold a penalty to this commandment.
3.6.
By judgment of the preliminary relief judge of the Noord-Holland court, location Haarlem, from 6 June 2023, [plaintiff] was offered to stop and stop the procedure (s) in Iran, with regard to the dowry of 314 gold coins, onPunishment of a penalty of € 2,500 to be paid for each day that she does not comply with this, with a maximum of € 25,000.(hereinafter: the judgment of 6 June 2023).
3.7.Subsequently, [defendant] ordered the bailiff to execute the judgment of 6 June 2023 and to collect penalty payments.All credits of [plaintiff] have been seized at ING Bank.A vehicle of [plaintiff] has also been seized.
3.8.
By letter of 1 July 2023, the lawyer of [plaintiff] in Iran has the following message:
"" Dear Mr.[defendant]
In the Matter of the Petition Filed by Your Former Wife Ms.[plaintiff], I would like to inform that:
Neiter the petitioner Nor Her Attorney Have Filed Any Application with the Family Court for withdrawal or Discontinuance of the Case.I have already sent the final appellate decision rendered by the appellate court.The Said Decision had Been Rendered Following the Appeal from the Decision of the Trial Court Filed by Ms.[plaintiff].It is a final decision your former wife &#39; s Claim of Dower Thereby the Decision of the Trial Court Has Been upheld.Rendering of the Final Decision by Appellate Court is Indicative of the Fact That Ms.[plaintiff] has not filed any request for withdrawal of the case while she has tasks advantage of all the meeans avia times to her to contest the court &#39; s ruling ”

The dispute
4.1.
[plaintiff] progresses by judgment, for as much as possible enforceable in stock:
I. the execution of the judgment of 6 June 2023 of the preliminary relief judge of the Noord-Holland court, location Haarlem, in suspension until the soil procedure has been decided;
Ii.to order [defendant] to eliminate the seizure of [plaintiff], including the seizure of a vehicle belonging to it, within twenty -four hours after the judgment has been served;
III.to determine that [defendant] owes a penalty of € 500 per day for each day that he fails to comply with the conviction under II;
Iv.order [defendant] to pay the costs of these summary proceedings.
4.2.
[plaintiff] based on its claims that the judgment of 6 June 2023 apparently is based on a factual mistake, because it is conclusively established that there was no longer any question of a procedure in Iran concerning the bridal gift at that time.The man acts unlawfully by nevertheless collecting penalty payments.
4.3.
[defendant] defends and concludes to reject the claims.
4.4.
The statements of the parties are discussed below, insofar as relevant.
5
The assessment
Canceling seizure
5.1.
In this summary proceedings, among other things, the question arises as to whether the enforceral seizures charged to [plaintiff] should be lifted.Explanation of an enforceable attachment may, among other things, be on the agenda if the attachment has been made unlawful because no penalty payments have been forfeited.
5.2.
[plaintiff] states that the attachment has been made unlawful and that [defendant] acts unlawfully towards her due to the seizure.According to [plaintiff], there is no title for the seizure because no penalty payments have been forfeited.She has held to the commandment as included in the judgment of 6 June 2023.
5.3.
On the other hand, [defendant] states that penalty payments have been forfeited because [plaintiff] has not fulfilled the judgment of 6 June 2023.
According to [defendant], an active act of [plaintiff] is required, namely the withdrawal of the previously paving procedure with regard to the dowry.According to [defendant], [plaintiff] did not do this.It is possible that [plaintiff] went into cassation and has not yet submitted the cassation scripture.According to the lawyer of [plaintiff] in Iran, a pro forma cassation has been submitted and the period has been covered.This is evident from the under 3.8.quoted letter.A final decision (Final Decision) has been taken, but this does not mean there is no cassation option.Because it has not been shown that [plaintiff] made known to the judicial authorities in Iran to withdraw the legal proceedings (s), [defendant] believes that there is no active act and that [plaintiff] has not complied with thejudgment of 6 June 2023.
5.4.
Thepreliminary relief judge is considering as follows.At the hearing, [plaintiff] stated several times that he had not established a cassation and that he would not do this.The obligation to pay and the burden of proof that penalty payments have been forfeited rest in the execution phase on the executor.That this is a conviction in the form of a commandment and not in the form of a ban does not make this different.It is therefore on the road of [defendant] as an executor to make it plausible that [plaintiff] did not comply with her obligation from the dictum of the judgment of 6 June 2023.[Defendant] did not comply with this.Contrary to what [defendant] states, the letter from the lawyer of [plaintiff] in Iran cannot be deduced that cassation appeal has been lodged and/or that there is still a procedure for the bridal gift.For the rest, it does not show that there is still a procedure.The fact that [plaintiff] has not shared to the judicial authorities in Iran that she will not set an appeal in cassation, does not make this any different.After all, it was neither stated nor proved that the procedure continues to run in Iran even after a final decision if you do not actively state the proceedings to terminate the procedure.
5.5.
The conclusion is that it is not likely that [plaintiff] did not comply with the judgment of 6 June 2023 and forfeited penalty payments.This means that for the time being it must be assumed that the seizures have been laid unlawfully and that they must be lifted.At the hearing, [plaintiff] stated and not disputed by [defendant] that a bank seizure and seizure on a vehicle belonging to [plaintiff] was laid.A letter from ING submitted by [defendant] pursuant to the bank attachment laid down states that no credit was found at the time of seizure and for that reason the seizure is considered to be canceled.However, none of the parties argued that the bank attachment no longer exists.The claim for the cancellation of these attachments will therefore be granted in a manner to be reported.
5.6.
The advanced penalty of € 500 per day will be allocated.The preliminary relief judge will maximize the penalty to an amount of € 10,000.
Suspension enforcement judgment
5.7.
In addition, the question is whether the [defendant] should be prohibited to enforce the judgment of 6 June 2023.
5.8.
As a starting point, a conviction declared in stock must be able to be enforced.In view of the Ritzen/Hoekstra judgment (NJ 1984, 145) of the Supreme Court of 22 April 1983, the preliminary relief judge can only suspend the execution of a judgment in an enforcement difference if he is of the opinion that the executor - partly in view of the interests onthe side of the executed person who will be harmed by the execution - has no reasonable interest to be used when using his authority to proceed with enforcement.This may be the case if the judgment to be executed apparently is based on a legal or factual mistake or if the enforcement has occurred after this judgment or to light facts apparently on the part of the executed will create a state of emergency, as a result of which, as a result of whichAn immediate enforcement cannot be accepted.
5.9.
By judgment of 20 December 2019 (ECLI: NL: HR: 2019: 2026), the Supreme Court stipulated that the aforementioned assessment framework also applies in summary proceedings in which no legal remedy is no longer open.In that case, the conviction of which the enforcement is under discussion is final.There is only ground for suspension in the event of - in short - abuse of authority within the meaning of Section 3:13 of the Dutch Civil Code (hereinafter: BW).The Supreme Court has also considered that there is no reason to limit the ground for suspension to the cases referred to in the judgment of 22 April 1983.Other situations may also arise in which, in connection with the facts that arose after the ruling or to light, there is a misuse of authority in accordance with the measure referred to in Article 3:13 of the Dutch Civil Code.A competence can among other things be abused by exercising it with no other purpose than harming the other or with a purpose other than for which it has been granted or in the event that one takes into account the disproportionate between the interest in the exercise and the importanceThat this is being damaged, could not have come to that exercise in reasonableness.In that context, new facts can also put weight on the scale.
5.10.
The preliminary relief judge is of the opinion that unspectered enforcement of the judgment of 6 June 2023 in the present circumstances provides abuse of authority.This is the reason for the preliminary relief judge to suspend the execution of the judgment of 6 June 2023.This is explained below.
5.11.As considered above, it is not sufficiently plausible for the time being that [plaintiff] has currently forfeited penalty payments.Execution is only on the agenda when it is established that [plaintiff] did not comply with what it has been convicted of.That it cannot be excluded that [plaintiff] may have applied for cassation appeal or will set in Iran does not form a legitimate basis for the execution of the judgment of 6 June 2023.
This means that there is currently no basis for enforcement of the judgment of 6 June 2023.The fact that [defendant] did, however, proceed to execution provides a sufficient basis for suspension of the execution, because the actions of [defendant] can be regarded as an abuse of rights.The following is also important.
5.12.
[plaintiff] states that the judgment of 6 June 2023 could not have been given in this form in the event of a correct representation of affairs.The defense of [plaintiff] has been misinterpreted because of a language barrier and the lack of legal aid.At the time of the summary proceedings on 23 May 2023, the parties did not have a Dutch translation of the judgments of legal proceedings in Iran.Now that [plaintiff] has still submitted the Dutch translations in these summary proceedings procedure, there are new facts and/or circumstances.However, at the time of those summary proceedings procedure, [defendant] could already be considered known with the content of the Iranian statements because he can read Farsi.That [defendant], despite the fact that he was familiar with the content of these statements, nevertheless started summary proceedings procedure to strike and stopping procedures in Iran about the dowry provides abuse of authority.After all, [defendant] knew, after all, knowing that these procedures had already been ended at that time, according to [plaintiff].
5.13.
[defendant] first of all disputes that he was familiar with the content of the decision on appeal, because he only received a copy of the decision months later.In addition, [defendant] disputes that the (translation) of the ruling of the Iranian court on appeal shows that the proceedings in Iran have ended.
5.14.
The preliminary relief judge is considering as follows.Although it is not entirely clear when [defendant] exactly received the decision on appeal, [plaintiff] stated undisposed that she took that decision in Farsi to the summary proceedings of 23 May 2023. From that moment on, [defendant] can be able to doThe content of the Iranian procedure on appeal is considered known.
That circumstance also means that [defendant] could not fully proceed with the execution of the judgment of 6 June 2023.
5.15.
The preliminary relief judge will therefore suspend the execution of the judgment of 6 June 2023 until it is established that [plaintiff] has forfeited penalty payments because she did not pay the convictions from the judgment of 6 June 2023.
Proceedings
5.16.
The preliminary relief judge sees no reason to deviate from the general principle that in the event of ex-speeches the costs between the parties will be compensated, in the sense that each party bears its own costs.
