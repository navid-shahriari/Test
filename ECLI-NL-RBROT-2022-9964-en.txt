Defendants,
[defendant02] has appeared in person, also on behalf of [defendant03] and as a representative of [defendant01].

[defendant02] and [defendant03] are mentioned separately by name.
1.
The further course of the procedure
1.1.
The file also consists of the following procedural documents:
-
the judgment of 8 April 2022;
-
the deed of [claimant01] of 2 June 2022;
-
The role decision of 29 July 2022 in which [defendant01] was given the opportunity to respond to the deed of [plaintiff01].
2.
The further assessment
2.1.
Reference is made to what was considered and decided in the judgment of 8 April 2022.The content of that judgment is considered here.
2.2.
In the interlocutory judgment of 8 April 2022, [plaintiff01] is admitted to the provision of [defendant01] that was proven to be proven to be proven for the time being that the amount of € 660.00 transferred in February 2021 relates to an advance on the wage for the month of February2021.
2.3.
In the context of providing proof to the contrary to its deed of 2 June 2022, [plaintiff01] has argued that an advance on the wage must be laid down in writing and that settlement of an advance on the basis of Article 7: 632 paragraph 1 preamble under c BWIt is only permitted if it appears in writing that there is an advance on the wage.However, the evidence submitted by [defendant01] only consists of a bank statement stating the word "advance" as a payment description.From this, according to [claimant01], it cannot simply be deduced that he has agreed to receive this payment as an advance on the wage, at least the part of the wage that is paid per bank.
2.4.
[plaintiff01] has further stated that taxes and premiums must be paid on a wage of wages, but that the wage specification submitted by [defendant01] does not show that more tax and premium has been paid for the month of February 2021 than about the usual SV-wages of € 1,812.70 per month that was paid on 24 February 2021.The amount that is qualified by [defendant01] is not included in this and, according to [claimant01], can therefore not be qualified as an advance on wages.
2.5.
Furthermore, [plaintiff01] pointed out that [defendant01] has not contradicted that the screen print of an Excel file submitted by [plaintiff01] relates to a part of the wage that was paid in cash.[Defendant01] only stated in the procedure that the overview does not relate to the months of February 2021 and May 2021, but on July 2020. At the same time, [defendant01] stated, according to [claimant01], that a wage calculation is made every monthAnd a wage specification is set out on the basis of which employees are paid.This confirms [defendant01] that the wage specification submitted is not reliable.After all, the cash paid hours of the month of July 2020 are not mentioned on the wage specification of the month of July 2020.
2.6.
The question now for answering is whether [plaintiff01] was successful in the proof to the contrary to be delivered by him.To this end, the subdistrict court judge is considering the following.
2.7.
[Defendant01] was given the opportunity to respond to the deed of [plaintiff01] in the roll decision of 29 July 2022, but did not use this opportunity.[defendant01] has left the further statements of [claimant01] undisputed.
2.8.
[plaintiff01] has further appealed to Article 7: 632 of the Dutch Civil Code.This article stipulates - in short - that an employer may settle the wage he owes with an advance on the wage, if it appears in writing.It has neither been stated nor proved that this requirement has been met.In the opinion of the subdistrict court judge, the bank statement with the mention "advance" is insufficient for this.[Plaintiff01] also stated that there is no more tax and premium for the month of February 2021 than about the usual SV wage for that month.If there had been a paid advance on top of the regular wage of that month, this should have been the case.With reference to the Excel sheet submitted by him as production 5 by summons, [plaintiff01] stated that part of the wage of the month of July 2020 was paid in cash.[Defendant01] has not contradicted that this part of the wage does not occur on the wage specification submitted by [plaintiff01] as production 6 by reply for the month of July 2020. This does not mean that the correctness of the wage specifications of [defendant01] can be assumed.
In view of this, the subdistrict court judge is of the opinion that [plaintiff01] the statement of [defendant01] that is proven to be proven for the time being that the amount of € 660.00 relates to an advance on the wage for the month of February 2021 sufficiently.[plaintiff01] has therefore passed the proof to the contrary instructed to him.
2.9.
This means that it is not certain that the amount of € 660 relates to an advance for the wage for the month of February 2021. [defendant01] was therefore not entitled to settle this amount at the end of the employment contract with the wage onThe month of May 2021 (namely the period May 1 to May 12, 2021).What [plaintiff01] has therefore demanded under I. will therefore be granted, in the sense that [defendant01], [defendant02] and [defendant03] are jointly and severally ordered to pay an amount of € 660 net.
litigation
2.10.
The legal increase is intended as an incentive for the employer to pay the wage in time, so that the employee can have this in time.Because [defendant01] has not paid the salary of [plaintiff01] in time without good reason and, moreover, has not been defined separately against the claimed legal increase, the legal increase of 50% will also be granted.
legal interest
2.11.
The claim for payment of the statutory interest on the wage claim and the statutory increase is also assignable to the law.
proceedings
2.12.
[defendant01], [defendant02] and [defendant03] are for the most part uneven and must therefore pay the costs of proceedings.The subdistrict court judge sets these costs on the side of [plaintiff01] until today at € 129.45 in summons costs, € 85.00 in court fees and
€ 372.00 in salary for the authorized representative (3 points x € 124 rate).This is a total of € 586.45.For costs that [plaintiff01] incurs after this decision, [defendant01] must also pay an amount of € 124.00.Another amount can be added for the service of the decision.There is no need to make a separate decision in this judgment (ECLI: NL: HR: 2022: 853).

This judgment is declared enforceable in stock, as advanced.
