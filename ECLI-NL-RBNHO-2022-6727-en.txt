The process of process
1.1.
The claimants lodged a claim against [defendant] by summons of 15 June 2021.[defendant] answered in writing.
1.2.
A hearing took place on July 4, 2022.The clerk has made notes of what the parties have explained to explain their views.Prior to the hearing, plaintiffs sent a USB stick with three videos by letter dated 14 September 2021.[Defendant] sent documents by letter dated 7 March 2022.

The facts
2.1.
[plaintiff 2] is the mother of [plaintiff 1].Plaintiffs and [defendant] lived together in the neighborhood at the time.[defendant] still lives there, together with his girlfriend (hereinafter: [the girlfriend]) and (now) their children.
2.2.
Plaintiffs, [defendant] and [the girlfriend] on November 3, 2020, in an unpleasant way, discussed a parking space for the claimants' home, which ultimately resulted in a verbal and physical confrontation between claimants and [defendant] and [The girlfriend], who was very pregnant at the time.The parties do not agree on what exactly happened - who was/were aggressor (s) and who victim (s) and whether damage was suffered by claimants as a result of the confrontation.
2.3.
After the incident, the police were called who came by.On November 4, 2020 and [plaintiff 2], [plaintiff 1] reported simple abuse to the police on 8 February 2021.[the girlfriend] reported simple abuse on 1 February 2022.Nothing else has been done with the declarations.
2.4.
[Defendant] reported insult/defamation and defamation on November 25, 2021, after he had been taken out of bed by the police on the basis of a report from the claimants.That case has been dismissed.
2.5.
Plaintiffs have since moved.

The progress
3.1.
Claimants claim that the subdistrict court judge:
I. declares that [defendant] is liable towards [plaintiff 1] for the damage as a result of the mistreatment on November 3, 2020;
Ii.it is declared that [defendant] is liable towards [plaintiff 2] for the damage as a result of the mistreatment on November 3, 2020;
III.[Defendant] condemns compensation to [plaintiff 1] in the state;
Iv.[Defendant] condemns compensation to [plaintiff 2] in the state;
V. [defendant] orders the costs of the proceedings including subsequent costs, plus the statutory interest.
3.2.
The claimants are based on the claim - briefly displayed - that [defendant] has expressed himself discriminatory against the claimants, physically abused them and damaged a vehicle.[defendant] pushed [plaintiff 1] on the hood of the car and then beat and kicked and kicked it several times while she was already on the ground.[Plaintiff 2] was also beaten by [defendant] and kicked in her belly.[The girlfriend] also physically abused the claimants.On the basis of Article 6: 166 of the Dutch Civil Code, [defendant] is jointly and severally liable for the violence applied by [the girlfriend].Plaintiffs have suffered damage due to the abuse, both physically and mentally.

The defense
4.1.[defendant] disputes the claim and argues - in summary - that he or [the girlfriend] but claimants are the instigators for the collision between the parties.While [the girlfriend] parked her car in a public place, the claimants who just arrived were shouted that [the girlfriend] had to go back with her car so that the claimants could park there.Although [defendant] and [the girlfriend] initially tried to run away from the situation, they ran back when they saw that [plaintiff 1] was facing their car.[plaintiff 1] then grabbed the wrists of [the girlfriend] and started pulling her.This was followed by a struggle between parties.The claimants have therefore started the aggressive behavior, against which [defendant] has weathered himself.There is therefore no question of committing an unlawful act.This is also apparent from the inconsistencies in the declarations, the summons, the injury report and the photos submitted by the claimants.It is not legally convincingly proven that [defendant] has committed an unlawful act against the claimants.That is why the liability for damage is canceled, according to [defendant].

The assessment
5.1.
With regard to the course of the incident, parties disagree.At the hearing, the authorized representative of the claimants had two videos of the situation playing on November 3, 2020, while stills of these videos have also been submitted as photos.The subdistrict court judge found the following on the videos and photos.[the girlfriend] has just parked the car of [defendant], when claimants came to drive at the car of [defendant].They stop their car next to the parked car of [defendant].[the girlfriend] gets out of the car.After claimants have also stepped out of their car, who is still standing next to [defendant's] car, [defendant] and [the girlfriend] walk away from the claimants.While they walk away, the conversation always touches and hears the subdistrict court judge [defendant] say, "Call, just call."Then things are said back and forth and the images show that [plaintiff 1] gives a strike against the car of [defendant].It is unclear which part of the car touches [plaintiff 1].After this, [defendant] loses his control and pushes [plaintiff 1] on the hood of her own car.She falls to the ground.The second video shows that [the girlfriend] and [plaintiff 2] also interfere with the fight and that people are pushing and pulling together.Although the claimants have argued that [defendant] has beaten claimants with a clenched fist and kicked [plaintiff 1], this is not visible on the video or the photos.[Defendant] has strongly disputed this, pointing out that he cannot afford such behavior in his profession as a security guard.
5.2.
The subdistrict court judge judges as follows.In the summons, plaintiffs pointed to the "decency standard" that people are allowed to park for their own home, but the subdistrict court judge does not participate.The parking space in front of the claimants' home is a public parking space.There is no such thing as a decency standard with regard to the (non) parking of cars for a certain home.Although the plaintiffs have stated that they only asked [the girlfriend] if she wanted to put her car a bit forward, [the girlfriend] disputed and argued that claimants immediately started screaming and the signals of the car lamps.It is indeed unclear what was said back and forth, but in the opinion of the subdistrict court judge, the claimants should have stopped further insisting when it turned out that [the girlfriend] did not want to move the car and she got out of the car and walked to her home.Plaintiffs should have accepted that.Nevertheless, the claimants continued to push.Although [plaintiff 1] has argued that she was triggered to kick the car of [defendant] because he would have expressed himself discriminatory against her and her mother, the video does not hear that [defendant] is discriminatory.This statement has not been stuck, at least the precise words cannot be traced.In addition, the words used according to the claimants did not give sufficient reason to [plaintiff 1] to kick the car, certainly not as hard as [plaintiff 1] did according to the film images.The fact that she only kicked the tire of the car, which was not stuck because it is not visible on the videos, does not mean that.In view of the foregoing, the stairs of [plaintiff 1] was disproportionate and it was understandable that [defendant] wanted to remove her from his car.
5.3.Subsequently, the fight was escalated further, creating a scuffle and pushed and pulled together.The subdistrict court judge finds it, based on the visual material, it is likely that not only the claimants have suffered any injury, but also [the girlfriend] also had a scratch on her face.However, the photos and film images shown do not show that [defendant] or [the girlfriend] have kicked claimants or hit with a clenched fist, as they do say.This is also not apparent from the forensic medicine submitted by the claimants.It states that the injury
possibly
Fits with the circumstances set by the claimants and that is insufficient to be able to establish that there would have been kicked and fisted.The reports also show that the injury will cure without permanent damage in the event of uncomplicated course within 1 week.This also confirms that there was no excessive violence.
5.4.
Before the crowds that got out of hand, [defendant] and/or [the girlfriend] cannot be blamed, in the sense that their actions has been unlawful.The subdistrict court judge finds that their actions has been provoked so much by the behavior of the claimants that the behavior of [defendant] and [the girlfriend] against claimants has not been unlawful in the given circumstances.[Defendant] can therefore not be obliged to compensate the psychological and other damage caused by the claimants.
5.5.
The conclusion is that the subdistrict court judge will reject the claims of claimants.
5.6.
The costs of the proceedings are for the account of claimants because they are wrong.
5.7.
What the parties have further put forward needs no more discussion, now that this cannot lead to another decision in the light of what has been established and considered in this judgment.
