Facts
In the judgment under 1.1 to 1.4, the subdistrict court judge listed the facts that it has taken as the starting point for assessing the case.These facts are not in dispute and therefore also serve the court as a starting point.Where necessary, supplemented with other facts that follow from not contradicted propositions of parties or the not (sufficiently) contested content of productions to which they refer to their propositions, the facts amount to the following.
2.1.
Parties have been married.Some time after the divorce they started living together again.They have four minor children aged 1 to 16 years.
2.2.
From mid -2016 to mid -2019, with their children, they have lived together in the rental home at [address 1] in [place] (hereinafter also: the house).The lease with regard to this property is only in the name of [appellant].The landlord of the house is Vesteda.
2.3.
After the end of the affective relationship between the parties, [appellant] [the respondent] summoned to leave the house by his then lawyer at the latest on 28 August 2019 because only [appellant] is a tenant and no tenant rights arrive at [respondent].Afterwards he replaced the ditches of the house.

Judgement
3.1.
On the claim of [the respondent], the subdistrict court judge [appellant], insofar as it is still relevant on appeal, convicted to cooperate with the landlord Vesteda for [respondent] within three days of service of the judgment with the landlord Vesteda with regardUntil the home, in the absence of which the judgment must be regarded as the cooperation of [appellant].
The costs of the proceedings are compensated between the parties.In summary, the subdistrict court judge has considered that there is no reason to assume that Vesteda [respondent] will not accept as a co -tenant and that it has not been sufficient that it will not be able to pay the rent for the home.In mid -2016, the parties moved together in the home and conducted a common household there for three years.Although [the respondent] no longer lives in the home, a request for co -tenancy can also be made within a reasonable period of time after the cohabitation of the cohabitation.The parties did not state that they have had a certain intention that only [appellant] is stated as a tenant in the lease.[respondent] has stated that the only reason why she is not on the lease is not located in the time of the signing thereof in the hospital in connection with the child's birth.The subdistrict court judge therefore assumes that the circumstance that [appellant] has become a tenant and not [the respondent] is rather based on a conscious choice of the parties.The scope of Article 7: 267 of the Dutch Civil Code is to protect the interests of the cohabitant in relation to the landlord, not to determine the legal position of the cohabitants.Now that the parties have not arranged their mutual legal relationship, the subdistrict court judge for the time being that the rent law is entitled to the parties in their mutual relationship and in principle have equal rights with regard to the home.The current situation of [respondent] is unhappy compared to the situation of [appellant].[respondent] is forced to live with the children with her mother in a senior apartment that does not lend herself to habitation by six people, while [appellant] now only lives in a large home.Under these circumstances, [appellant] can be required to cooperate in applying for the co -tenancy for [respondent].By not doing this, [appellant] acts contrary to what is according to unwritten law.It has not been found that [the respondent] can go to the [address 2] with the children in the rental home, because it was rented to third parties by the landlord of that house, Stadgenoot.She has given up that property because she moved to the house at [address 1] together with [appellant] in connection with family expansion.So far the subdistrict court judge in the contested judgment of 10 March 2020.
3.2.
By e-mail of 15 March 2020 to Vesteda, with the contested judgment as an appendix, [the respondent] requested co-tenancy with reference to the decision given therein.Vesteda has refused to grant the request.[respondent] subsequently brought a procedure against Vesteda to the subdistrict court judge to still obtain the co -tenancy of the home.At the time of the oral hearing in front of the Court, no decision was made in that case.
3.3.
[Appellant] with his complaints arises against the decision in the contested judgment and the statement of reasons.
3.4.
[appellant] claims, among other things, that [the respondent] is ordered to pay the costs of the procedure at the subdistrict court judge, while the subdistrict court judge has compensated for the costs between the parties.This gives [appellant] an interest in the handling of the case on appeal.[respondent] still has an urgent interest in her claim, already because Vesteda can return from her refusal to grant the co -tenancy.The remark of [appellant] (for explanation of his production 13), stating: "Vesteda and her lawyer have informed [appellant] that Vesteda has rejected the requests for co -tenancy of [the respondent] and
as yet
(Court of Court) will continue to reject "points out that Vesteda could still change its position.
3.5.The complaints of [appellant] lend themselves to joint treatment.He stated on appeal, among other things, that it is not based on coincidence that he is the only tenant of the home, but that the parties have explicitly agreed this.During their cohabitation, [the respondent] asked him several times in the period from 2012 to 2016 in the house rented by [the respondent] at [address 2] to leave her home.That was why he went looking for his own rental home.When he found the house at [address 1], he first lived there for almost a year.[respondent] was not in the hospital at the time of the signing of the lease.At the end of 2016, when the relationship between parties had improved, [the respondent] was withdrawn from him.They then agreed that she would continue her own rental home, in case their relationship would deteriorate or end up again.[respondent] temporarily sublet her rental home to her girlfriend [X] and only sold this home to [X] on September 17, 2019, after the relationship between the parties had ended and he had announced [the respondent] that she had the homehad to leave at [address 1], according to [appellant].
3.6.
In response to this defense, [the respondent] stated, among other things, that the parties jointly went looking for a larger home for their family in 2015 in connection with family expansion, and that after a renovation in the home at [address 1] they jointlyLiving with the children.
3.7.
In contrast to [appellant], [respondent] has made her position plausible with productions.These productions show that parties were looking for a home together in 2015.For example, [the respondent] submitted an e-mail from her to 'Ikwilhuren.nu rental office [place]' of 10 February 2015, with the subject 'Re: view confirmation', in which she asks what this organization needs' if we have the propertywant to rent '.She also brought a landlord's statement of 18 March 2015 from Stadgenoot, the landlord of the house at [address 2], as well as one by [respondent] as '1st applicant' and [appellant] as '2nd applicant' on 27March 2015 signed registration form for a home in the housing project [A] in [place], which states that they were looking for another home in connection with 'composition of household' and 'family expansion'.Moreover, it can be deduced from the productions submitted by [the respondent] that the contracts with Waternet and Nuon have been put to the home for the purpose of supplying water or energy to the home, starting on 2 February 2016 or 2 May 2016 respectively, as alsoThe contract with Feenstra for Maintenance & Service and Connection Private Alarm Center, which Feenstra confirmed to it by letter of 26 April 2016.
3.8.
Although [appellant] contested on appeal that [the respondent] was in the hospital at the time of the signing of the lease on January 18, 2016 because she already gave birth to a baby in October 2015, who on October 25, 2015died, on the occasion of the oral hearing, he did not dispute that she was in the hospital around the signing of the lease as a result of complications that occurred then, as it has stated in response.
3.9.
In view of what has been considered above under 3.7 and 3.8, the statement of [appellant] is that [the respondent] only came to live in the home at the end of 2016 and that the circumstance that she has not become a co -tenant on an appointment or conscious choice of partiesRest not become plausible.Against this background, the Court of Appeal with the subdistrict court judge is of the opinion that the rental right is jointly entitled to the parties in their mutual relationship and that in principle they have equal rights with regard to the home.That before [appellant], by means of a letter from his then lawyer, denied access to the house and then replaced the ditches of the house, made a vain attempt to keep [appellant] out of the house and the ditchesThe Court of Appeal does not consider substantial importance for the assessment of the claim in this case.
3.10.Apart from the question of whether the apartment of the mother of [the respondent] is a three or four-room home and whether the house, with garden, at [address 1] has only four rooms or, after renovating the house and accompanying garage, six rooms, [appellant] stated in the apple summons itself that the surface of the mother's apartment is 73 square meters and of the house at [address 1] 90 square meters.That is a substantial difference.The Court therefore endorses the consideration of the subdistrict court judge that the (currently unaltered) actual living situation of [respondent] and the four children of parties compared to that of [appellant] is unhappy to be unhappy.The fact that the apartment of the mother of [the respondent] is not a senior apartment as the subdistrict court judge has not changed that.
3.11.
[appellant] has, by [the respondent], defeated herself in her current living situation by redeeming the rental home at [address 2] on 17 September 2019 'to her girlfriend [X], in essence only supported by the cover sheet of a lease between Stadgenoot as the landlord and (among other things) [X] as a tenant.That is, without further explanation, that is lacking, insufficient to consider it plausible that [the respondent] has voluntarily renounced this rental home at a time that she knew she needed it in connection with the termination of the affective relationship between the parties.The other productions placed by [appellant] cannot lead to a different opinion.
3.12.
Furthermore, [the appellant] has not made it plausible to the reasoned dispute by [the respondent] that it offers insufficient guarantee for a proper fulfillment of the rent from a financial point of view.
3.13.
In view of all the foregoing, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that it could yet be required of [appellant] that he cooperated in applying for the co -tenancy for [respondent].By not doing that, [appellant] acted contrary to the reasonableness that parties such as former spouses and partners, with four children between the ages of 1 and 16, also have to deal with each other after the end of their cohabitation.
3.14.
With the propositions of [appellant] that he has great importance in the preservation of the home for himself and that the verdict cannot be executed, because parties can no longer live together and alternating stay in the home is also no solution, he misunderstands that inThe present procedure is only discussed whether, after termination of society between the parties, the aforementioned cooperation can be expected to obtain co -tenancy from the lessor.As the subdistrict court judge rightly considered, the scope of Article 7: 267 of the Dutch Civil Code is to protect the interests of the cohabitant, in this case [respondent], in relation to the lessor and not for the tenant's legal position, in this case [appellant], and to determine the cohabiting.In other words: in the present procedure it is not the question of which of the parties will ultimately be the rental rights with the exclusion of the other.
3.15.
The conclusion of all the foregoing is that the complaints fail.The verdict for which an appeal will be ratified.Because parties are former life partners, the costs of the first instance are rightly compensated.For the same reason, the costs of the appeal will also be compensated as to be reported.
