4.5
The woman asks the man to declare inadmissible, at least to reject the requested by him.
5
The reasons for the decision
In principle and in an incidental appeal
5.1
The issue is the settlement of the matrimonial assets of parties and the bridal gift.
Competence Dutch court
5.2
According to the (interim) decision of 13 November 2019 in this case, the court is of the opinion that the Dutch court is authorized to take cognizance of the requests.The man argues on appeal that the Dutch court is not competent, now that the separation and claims related to the separation must be dealt with in Iran.To this end, the man submits a statement translated into English of April 21, 2020 from Mr.Mohammadreza Baghizadeh, lawyer in Iran.The woman defends.
The Court is considering the following.
At the time of the submission of the petition for divorce, the parties had their main residence in the Netherlands.In view of this, the Dutch court comes on the basis of Article 3, first paragraph, opening words and under a, first line, of the Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 on the authority and recognition and execution of decisions in marriage casesand with regard to parental responsibility, and to the withdrawal of Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 (hereinafter referred to as: Brussels II-bis) jurisdiction with regard to the request for divorce.
Now that the divorce petition with ancillary provisions has been submitted after January 29, 2019, the jurisdiction of the Dutch court is determined to take cognizance of the requested ancillary provisions, determined on the basis of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1103 of the Council of 24 June 2016The implementation of closer cooperation in the field of authority, applicable law and recognition and execution of decisions in the field of matrimonial property systems.Pursuant to Article 5, first paragraph, of this Regulation, the Dutch court, now that he has on the basis of art.3 Brussels II-BIS is authorized to take cognizance of the divorce request, and also jurisdiction with regard to the ancillary facilities requested in the context of the divorce.From the aforementioned statement by Mr.Baghizadeh cannot deduce the Court of Appeal that the aforementioned regulations do not apply in this case.Nor has the man specified further to what extent Mr.Baghizadeh supports his position.As far as he refers to the last sentence of point 2 of the statement, stating: “
Therefore, none of the Dutch Courts is competent to hear the case, just in compliance with Iranian law ”,
that the man does not benefit, now that this sentence relates to the sentence for this
"The Wife’s Alimony Claim",
which is not an issue in the present case.Although the man states that the background of the bridal gift is the man's obligation to maintain the woman, but with the court the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the bridal has its own character under Iranian law and, as is also considered below, it is not equal to a maintenance obligation.
In view of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal, like the court in its decision of 13 November 2019, is of the opinion that the Dutch court is competent to take cognizance of the present dispute.
Applicable law
5.3
In its decision of 13 November 2019, the court also considered that Iranian law applies to the settlement of the matrimonial assets of the parties and the bridal gift on the basis of the provisions of the Hague Marriage Convention 1978 (hereinafter referred to as: HHV).With this as a starting point, the court applied Iranian law in the contested decision.In his defense on appeal, the man also states an incidental appeal that Dutch law applies.The court does not follow the man in this.Pursuant to Article 4 of the HHV, the matrimonial property regime of the spouses is governed by the internal law of the state of their common nationality, since the man and the woman have not designated the applicable law before marriage and they separate during the first year of their marriage separatelyFrom each other in the Netherlands and Iran, respectively.Now that they only have the Iranian nationality in common, the court has rightly and on good grounds that Iranian law applies to the matrimonial property regime applicable between the parties.The statement of the man that both parties now live in the Netherlands and the Iranian nationality of the man is not effective does not detract from the previous ones.
Wedding
5.4
The woman and the man both grieve against the judgment of the court that the man - in short - should pay Golden Coins to the woman 110 Bahar -Azadi.The woman takes the position that the man must meet her 1369 Bahar-Azadi gold coins, while the man believes that he does not owe any gold coins to the woman at all.The court will discuss the complaints of the parties on this point where possible.
5.5
In the contested decision, the court ruled that according to Iranian law, in the case of a bridal gift higher than 110 gold coins, there may indeed be reason to adjust the bridal gift, whereby the capacity of the man plays a role and the bridal gift throughThe Iranian court is used as a means to be able to make agreements about the termination of the marriage.The court has ruled that the handling of the request to the Dutch court, insofar as this exceeds the number of gold coins of 110, will lead to unnecessary delay within the meaning of Article 827, first paragraph, under a Code of Civil Procedure (Rv)and the woman is considered inadmissible to that extent.
5.6
The man argues that the marriage certificate of the parties is not valid because it is not signed by the required number of witnesses.According to the man, the marriage certificate must be signed by three witnesses on the part of the man and by three witnesses on the part of the woman, which did not happen.The woman has put forward a defense and states that the marriage certificate has been drawn up in accordance with Iranian law.
The court ignores the man's statement that the marriage certificate is not valid.It would have been on the man's way opposite the dispute by substantiating the woman on which land is required by Iranian law for a valid marriage certificate by three witnesses on the part of each spouse and what the consequences would be if not to that provisionis completed.On request, the man stated on request that he could not explain and substantiate this and has otherwise not given any further explanation of his position.The court therefore ignores this statement of the man.Provision supply is not arrived now that the man has not met his obligation.
5.7
The man furthermore states that the agreement included in the marriage certificate between the parties concerning the gold coins must be annulled due to a lack of will (error, deception and/or abuse of circumstances) or to the court understands that the agreement is not concludedCome because of the lack of consent.According to the man, at the time of signing the marriage certificate, he did not know what he signed for and was incorrectly informed by the woman and her family at this point.The bridal gift has not been discussed until the preparation of the marriage certificate.Only with the woman's defense at the divorce claim did he get to know the bridal gift and to pay half of his assets of the obligation.He also never wanted to oblige himself to satisfy a bridal gift of this size, according to the man.
The woman has put a defense.She argues that video recordings show that the man's family was present during the marriage closure and that the notary explained the deed orally to the parties.The parties have conducted extensive consultations in the presence of the man regarding the bridal gift.Present were the mother of the man, the wife of the uncle of the man and the cousin of the woman to consult with the man's family.The man was assisted by his family and he also speaks Farsi.All conditions were passed on with the man prior to the signing of the marriage certificate and the man (and his family) knew (s) what obligation the man concerned with regard to the bridal gift, according to the woman.The Court judges as follows.Now that Iranian law applies, the man wrongly appeals to Dutch provisions.Because the facts and circumstances that the man claims have not been established, the Court does not come to answer the question of whether Iranian law involves a lack of will or the lack of consent as a result of which the deed of marriage on the point ofthe gold coins cannot be maintained.After all, it has not been established that the man was not aware of the bridal gift at the time of the conclusion of the marriage certificate and was incorrectly informed by the woman's family, now that he was his position, partly in the light of the disputeBy the woman, insufficiently substantiated.The Court of Appeal takes into account that the man has stated on appeal on appeal that a notary explained to him when taking the marriage certificate what the rules are, as well as that his mother prior to the signing of the marriage certificate (non-verbal) has advised to agree to the recording of a bridal gift of 1369 gold coins.
The foregoing also applies insofar as the man also wanted to invoke the limiting effect of reasonableness and fairness within the meaning of Article 6: 248, second paragraph, of the Dutch Civil Code (BW).
5.8
With reference to Article 10: 6 of the Dutch Civil Code, the man also states that the agreement included in the marriage certificate on the Golden Coins will fight with Dutch public order.The legal figure of the bridal gift does not fit within Dutch matrimonial property law, because the background of the bridal gift is to maintain the woman by the man and the rules regarding partner alimony apply in the Netherlands.Moreover, a bridal gift of approximately € 400,000 is very burdensome and unacceptable under Dutch law, according to the man.The woman disputes that the agreed bridal gift is contrary to Dutch public order and that the background of the bridal gift under Iranian law can be equated with the rules regarding partner alimony in the Netherlands.
The Court of Appeal first of all states that Article 10: 6 of the Dutch Civil Code stipulates that strange law is not applied, insofar as its application is apparently incompatible with Dutch public order.The bridal gift concerns an appointment between (future) spouses and leads to a claim from the woman to the man, where the amount of the amount to be paid is negotiable.Contrary to what the man argues, the bridal gift does not concern a periodic benefit that is equal to partner alimony as referred to in Article 1: 157 of the Dutch Civil Code.Also from the size of the agreed bridal gift, even if, as the man argues, it is very stressful for him, no (apparent) struggle with Dutch public order can be derived.The fact that, as the man further states, his passport is taken during a trip to Iran and he is imprisoned because he has not provided the bridal gift, does not mean that the agreed bridal giving in itself will fight with Dutch public order.In view of the foregoing, starting points for a successful appeal to Article 10: 6 of the Dutch Civil Code.
5.9
On the basis of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal comes to the conclusion that the provision included in the marriage certificate is legally valid.In the following, the Court of Appeal will elaborate on the extent of the woman's claim on the man, now that the parties disagree on this.
5.10
In the first instance, a (anonymous) IJI report regarding the bridal gift was brought into the proceedings in Iran.The parties have not challenged the content thereof so that the Court will involve the principles of the report in the assessment.The report includes the following:
“"
In conclusion, it can be stated that Iranian law leaves a very limited space for recurring and/or correcting the woman's right to the bridal gift when the woman does not agree and/or if there is not (extrajudicial) "suitable".If it is a claim of above 110 Bahar Azadi gold pieces (approx. € 30,000), then litigation must be litigated and the capacity of the man can be taken into account in the judicial decision on claims regarding the (deferred) bridal giftwho are even higher.A repayment in installments is then possible, for example.However, the woman's claim for surplus remains due and payable from the moment the man has sufficient capacity or financial room for paying off the bridal gift again
. "
5.11From the passage above the IJI report, the Court of Appeal concludes that part of the bridal gift, consisting of 110 gold coins, is not eligible for moderation under Iranian law.With regard to the remaining part of the bridal gift, consisting of 1259 gold coins, (hereinafter referred to as: the Surplus), it is necessary to make proceedings where the man's capacity can be taken into account.The woman gritts against the judgment of the court that the handling of the request, insofar as this exceeds the number of gold coins of 110, will lead to unnecessary delay within the meaning of Article 827, first paragraph, under f CV.She argues that the demand for the man's capacity should be discussed in the procedure on the enforcement of the claim and therefore not in the present procedure.To this end, it refers to the IJI report.However, it did not make the reference in more detailed and, incidentally, the Court of Appeal cannot deduce from the report that what the woman states is correct.The above quote shows that this must be litigated on the surplus.This is precisely the case in the present procedure.It cannot be seen that only after allocation of the woman's request, in the execution phase, that should be assessed.Contrary to the court, the Court of Appeal is of the opinion that the handling of the request, insofar as this exceeds the number of gold coins of 110, will not lead to unnecessary delay within the meaning of Article 827, first paragraph, under f CV.After all, the man has - undisputed - not to have the capacity to meet the Surplus to the woman.It has been found that the man receives social assistance benefits and has no permanent home.In view of the foregoing, the man owes the full bridal gift to the woman, but the court will take the capacity of the man into account with regard to the request of the superior above 110 Bahar-Azadi Gold Coins and determine that it can be paid in installments.Taking into account the financial situation of the man, the Court considers it reasonable to determine that the man, as long as he has an income at social assistance level, must pay the surplus in installments of a gold currency per year.Furthermore, the Court of Appeal considers it to be reasonable that the equivalent of the first 110 Bahar-Azadi Gold Coins will be calculated in euros according to the date of the contested decision, as was determined by the court, which was not hurt.With regard to the surplus, the equivalent of the Bahar-Azadi gold coins must be calculated according to the date of satisfaction.The statutory interest requested by the woman (allocated by the court) will be included in the dictum for the sake of clarity and now that it has not been held on this point.
5.12
Finally, the man relies on the restrictive effect of the reasonableness and fairness of Article 6: 248, second paragraph, of the Dutch Civil Code and enables that moderation is also possible under Iranian law due to circumstances.To this end, he has set various circumstances on the basis of which it is unacceptable that the man would also have to pay a large sum of money and half of the value of the car to the woman.
Now that Iranian law applies, the man does not appeal to Article 6: 248, second paragraph, of the Dutch Civil Code.The man has insufficiently substantiated to what extent and on what legal basis for him under Iranian law, on moderation on the basis of the circumstances he mentioned.This had been on its road, all the more so paid to the IJI report that shows that moderation of the bridal gift is to a very limited extent and, as far as is known, no general legal principle or correction mechanism analogous to reasonableness and fairness exists on groundwhose bridal gift can be recovered or adjusted because of the man's financial situation.His appeal to moderation therefore fails.
Settlement of matrimonial power
5.13
With regard to the woman's request that she is entitled to half the value of the car, Fiat Punto, with registration number [license plate number], the Court considers as follows.
As included in the decision of the court of 8 January 2020 and against which there is no grabs, the Iranian matrimonial property law has the system of separation of goods.This means - in short - exclusion from every community of goods, so that what the spouses possessed at the time of entering into marriage and what they acquired during marriage is and remains private property.In the aforementioned decision it was also considered that the marriage certificate of the parties shows that they have agreed that if the divorce is vaccinated at the initiative of the man, the man will pay half of the value of the goods obtained to the woman during the marriage.There is no horror against this, so that the Court will also take this as the starting point.It is certain that the man has submitted the introductory divorce request and that he obtained the car at the time of the marriage of the parties.The man must therefore meet half the value of the car to the woman.The man states that he sold the car for € 5,000 in March 2020 and gave the proceeds to his aunt to repay debts.At the hearing on appeal, he also stated that he had purchased the car with borrowed money in 2019.Insofar as the man wanted to argue that debts must be taken into account when distributing (the value of) the car, the Court will pass this as being a tardif and contrary to the two-conclusion theory.
At the hearing on appeal, the woman agreed to a value of the car of € 5,000 and changed her request in accordance with (reduced).The Court of Appeal will allocate the woman's request and thus determine that the man must pay € 2,500 to the woman under distribution of the value of the car.
Conclusion
5.14
The Court of Appeal will destroy the contested decision and partly allocate requests of the woman with regard to the bridal gift as stated below and assign its request with regard to the car to an amount of € 2,500.The subsidiary request of the man concerning the bridal gift will be allocated insofar as it concerns the superior above 110 Bahar-Azadi gold coins that must be met in installments of 1 Bahar-Azadi gold coin per year or the equivalent in euros.The other requests will be rejected.
The costs of the proceedings will be compensated between the parties, since they are former spouses.

The decision
The Council:
In principle and in an incidental appeal:
Destroys the contested decision insofar as the Court of Appeal was subject to the judgment, and, again right:
condemns the man to hand over the wife to the woman 1369 Bahar-Azadi Gold Coins, to be satisfied in the following way:
- the man must pay 110 Bahar-Azadi gold coins or an equivalent in euros, calculated per date of the contested decision, to the woman within fourteen days after this decision is serviced;
-The man must meet the Surplus of 1259 Bahar-Azadi Gold Coins in terms of 1 Bahar-Azadi gold coin per year or an equivalent in euros, calculated per date of satisfaction, for the first time on January 1, 2022;
to increase the above with the statutory interest on the amount owed to the woman in euros from the moment of liability;
condemns the man for payment to the woman of an amount of € 2,500 (in a two thousand five hundred euros) on the basis of distribution of the value of the car;
The costs of the proceedings thus compensates that each party bears its own costs;
declares this decision to be enforced in stock;
rejects the requested more or otherwise on appeal.
This decision was given by T.A.M.Tijhuis, J. Jonkers, and M.C.Schenkeveld, in the presence of A. Paats as clerk and was pronounced in public on November 17, 2020 by the oldest counselor.
