Position of the Public Prosecution Service
The public prosecutor has perted at the position taken in the council chamber of 29 September 2020.He added that the Public Prosecution Service assumes that the defendant has acted in the interest of [name of dog], but that the interests of other people and other dogs should also be considered.That is the reason that the dog was confiscated and cannot return to the applicant.

Judgement
The following has been shown from the documents and the proceedings in the council chamber.
The assessment framework was set out in the interim decision of 2 October 2020.
By intermediary 2 October 2020, the court considered that it considered insufficiently informed in order to be able to carefully rated the complaint, now that information about the bite incident on 3 April 2020 on which the risk assessment team was partly lacking its risk analysis.The court has given the public prosecutor the opportunity to add the declaration as well as any other documents concerning the bite incident to the file on 3 April 2020.
The documents that the public prosecutor has added to the file following the interim decision of 2 October 2020 shows that a bite incident would have taken place on April 3, 2020, with the Dog of the complainant bitten another dog, which had to be treated for thatBy a vet.According to the complainant, the complainant's dog was not on a leash at that time.
In the present case there is a dog that, according to the Public Prosecution Service, is prone to forfeit or withdrawal from traffic.
In this case, the court must assess whether it is not highly unlikely that the criminal court, judgmental, will express the forfeit of the object or will impose the withdrawal of the object.
On the basis of the documents currently contained in the file, in particular the conclusion of the Assessment Team of Utrecht University and the trading in the council chamber, the court is of the opinion that it is not highly unlikely that the criminal court, judgmental, seizedtaken dog will withdraw from traffic.After all, several (bite) incidents have already taken place in the past.In addition, according to the assessment team of Utrecht University, the dog appears to show aggressive behavior to other dogs and the complainant does not seem to be a reliable owner to steer the aggressive behavior of the dog in the right direction.The recommendation is to have the dog chemically castrated and to relocate the dog.The court is therefore of the opinion that the criminal interest is opposed to cancellation of the attachment.
The complaint must therefore be declared unfounded.
