The facts
3.1.
The Court of Appeal is based on the facts established by the court insofar as this has not arisen on appeal.Among other things, the following is certain.
3.2.
The parties were married to each other on November 4, 2011 in [place 2], Iran.
3.3.
On February 18, 2022, the woman submitted a request for divorce (with ancillary facilities) to the Oost-Brabant District Court ('s-Hertogenbosch).The man did not appear in the first instance.
3.4.
In the contested decision of 17 May 2022, the court pronounced the divorce between the parties, among other things.
3.5.
The aforementioned (divorce) decision was registered on 27 October 2022 in the registers of the Civil Registry.
4
The size of the dispute
4.1.
In the case of the contested decision, it is furthermore, insofar as now relevant:
-
stipulates that the man must pay € 1,482 per month from the day on which the divorce decision is registered in the registrants of the civil status as a contribution to the costs of living of women;
-
the man sentenced to pay an amount of € 19,992 to the woman by virtue of the bridal gift, to increase with the statutory interest from the date of that decision;
-
The man convicted of handing over the wife 800 Bahar Azadi Gold Coins, within 14 days of the date of that decision, in the absence of which the man of this 800 Bahar Azadi Golden coins in euros (reversal courseper date of that decision) is due, plus the statutory interest on the amount due to the woman per date of that decision.
4.2.
The man has requested the decision that appeals to which an appeal, except insofar as it concerns the divorce pronounced by the court, and to reject or mitigate the requests of the woman.
4.3.
As far as possible, the woman requests the man to declare the man inadmissible in his requests for appeal, at least to reject those requests.Furthermore, the woman requests the man to condemn the costs of the wife of this appeal.
5
The reasons for the decision
5.1.In view of the fact that the man appealed on 15 February 2023, the Court of Appeal sees itself appealing to the decision of the Oost-Brabant Court ('s-Hertogenbosch) of 17 May 2022, first of all asked for the question whether the man canare received in his requests on appeal.
5.2.
The man has stated that he has not been known before with the decision of which an appeal has until his bank account has been seized.To date, the decision has not been served on its home address.The woman knew that the man stayed in Canada, more specifically [place 1].Thus she should have made the decision through a bailiff there.
The man points to a decision of the Court of The Hague of 31 January 2018 (ECLI: NL: RBDHA: 2018: 980) and a ruling of the Supreme Court of 2 December 1988 (ECLI: NL: HR: 1988: AB8208).
In this case, the application of the appeal period means that the man would not get a fair trial.That is contrary to art.6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).In this context, the man also points to a decision of the Supreme Court of 27 May 2011 (ECLI: NL: HR: 2011: BP8693).The man took action very soon after he has taken note of the contested decision.It is also plausible what the man says, because the contested decision has far -reaching consequences for him.
5.3.
The woman disputes that the man had not previously had science of divorce.The divorce decision is served correctly, the publications have been done correctly and the deed of non-apple has therefore been issued precisely, so that the registration of that decision in the registers of the Civil Registry could have taken place.Moreover, in the Iran procedure, the man requested non-compliance and in those procedure-of which the first statement dates from 12 September 2022-he has shown the Dutch divorce papers.Thus, the man is too late with the appeal and he must be declared inadmissible in this appeal.The man's profession on art.6 ECHR cannot succeed, because it has been done correctly.With that the man has had a fair trial.
5.4.
The court considers as follows.
5.5.
Article 816, paragraph 1, of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure provides in case a divorce request is submitted by one of the spouses, that the applicant will mean a copy thereof to the other spouse within fourteen days of the submission of the petition.The exploitation must state the time at which the other spouse can submit a statement of defense at the latest, either for a postponement and furthermore that this can only be done by a lawyer.The original exploitation must be submitted at the registry.Paragraph 2 contains the period that must be stated before submitting a defense or requesting deferment.Article 816, paragraph 3, of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure stipulates that if the provisions of paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 have not been taken into account, or if the exploitation otherwise suffers from a defect, the Artt.120 and 121 Rv are applicable (see also HR 1 April 2022, ECLI: NL: HR: 2022: 481).
5.5.1.
On February 18, 2022, the woman submitted a request for divorce (with ancillary facilities) to the Oost-Brabant District Court ('s-Hertogenbosch).
According to the exploitation, this request is referred to as the man on 24 February 2022 at the address [address] [house number] in ([postcode]) [place 3].An external extract from the Basic Registration of Persons (hereinafter: BRP), which was at that time, the man was registered at the aforementioned address.In view of the nature and purpose of the BRP, third parties may rely on the data included in the BRP.The man's statement that he did not actually stay on the address included in the BRP on 24 June 2022, therefore, is not a goal.Furthermore, it has not been shown that the service was incorrectly done, so that the man may be assumed with the petition submitted by the woman.
5.5.2.
On 17 May 2022, the court decided on the aforementioned divorce request with ancillary facilities of the woman.Pursuant to art.820 paragraph 1 Rv - in deviation from the provisions of art.358 paragraph 2 Rv - A spouse who did not appear in the proceedings in the first instance, against a decision in which a request for divorce has been granted, appeal to him in person or within three months within three months of the service of this decisionAfter it has been served in a different way and has been openly announced in accordance with the second paragraph.
According to the provisions of art.820 paragraph 2 Rv, the open announcement takes place by placing an extract of the decision in the Government Gazette.
5.5.3.The aforementioned extract from the BRP shows that the man will stay in Canada from 28 February 2022.Except for the mere mention in the BRP that the man is staying in Canada, it has not been shown that the woman was familiar with a specific address of the man in Canada at the time of the service and open announcement of the divorce decision.This means that the man had no well -known place of residence or a well -known real stay in and outside the Netherlands.Determination of the writ took place at the public prosecutor's public prosecutor of the Public Prosecution Service at the Oost-Brabant District Court ('s-Hertogenbosch) on 30 May 2022. Outlative announcement of the divorce decision took place in the Staatscourant (no. 15679) dated 10June 2022. All legal requirements have been taken into account.
5.5.4.
The foregoing implies that the three -month appeal period before the man started on 10 June 2022 and therefore (with due observance of the General Terms Act) ended on 12 September 2022.
5.5.5.
The fact that the man says - first after the expiry of this appeal period has actually taken note of the decision that appeals, does not change that.After all, it is not about whether or not the man has actually taken note of that decision within the appeal period, but it is about whether the man could take note of this in time.Now that the decision has been served correctly and has been made open openly (see rov. 5.5.3.) And therefore procedural guarantees are changed, his appeal to art.6 ECHR.The case law cited by the man cannot lead to a different opinion, since there are no comparable cases.
5.5.6.
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, with due observance of the foregoing, it is established that the man - who made an appeal to this court on 15 February 2023 against the divorce decision - appealed outside the appeal period.He cannot therefore be received in this appeal.
6
The conclusion
6.1.
On the basis of what has been considered above, the man must be declared inadmissible in his requests on appeal.
6.2.
The Court of Appeal sees no reason, as requested by the woman, to order the man to pay the costs of the proceedings and will compensate for the costs of proceedings on appeal, now that the parties are former spouses.
