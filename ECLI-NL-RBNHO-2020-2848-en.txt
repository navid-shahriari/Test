(...)
During various store visits, it was found that you do not adhere to Article 14 and do purchases with non -contract suppliers.We sent you a letter about this on 17 September.(...) Further investigation of your file has shown that you still do purchases from non -contract suppliers.
We will terminate the agreement with you if it appears that you will not comply with the obligations under your agreement after 30 days. "
2.6.
By letter of 12 March 2019, Delcata asked [plaintiff/defendant] for a certified copy of his operating license and pointed out that he may not operate the store without this permit and the agreement ends immediately.This request was repeated by letter of 11 April 2019.
2.7.
By e-mail of 1 April 2019, Delcate forwarded the report of inspection company Rentokil to [plaintiff/defendant] with the request to take the recommendations of Rentokil with regard to keeping the store clean immediately, so that it does notPrevent more.This request has been repeated by e-mail messages of 2 May and 1 July 2019.Delcata subsequently reported [plaintiff/defendant] on 9 July 2019 that Bureau De Wit reported to Delcata that The Döner Company Alkmaar has scored under parent with an audit on hygiene.Delcata has requested [plaintiff/defendant] to come up with a plan of action before 1 August 2019 to get a good result in the next re-inspection.
2.8.
On July 19, 2019, [A.], Commercial Manager at Delcata (hereinafter: [A.]), informed [plaintiff/defendant] via WhatsApp to [plaintiff]:
"Salam Roshat you can be Belle Alkmaar this basket last basket ns wants to trug"
.
2.9.
[A.] subsequently (also via WhatsApp) at [plaintiff/defendant] urged the location at Alkmaar station before July 29, 2019.He indicated that this is not related to the rental payments, but with the agreements with NS.[A.] has offered [plaintiff/defendant] the exploitation of a branch of The Döner Company in Haarlem as compensation.[plaintiff/defendant] did not address the eviction request.
2.10.
By letter of 29 July 2019, Delcata requested [plaintiff/defendant] to pay an amount of € 31,926.65 within 7 days, due to incorrectly granted discounts on the franchise allowance and rent the inventory for the period July 2018 - August 2019. Delcata.has added that it will terminate the agreement in the event of late payment.
2.11.
Also on July 29, 2019, Delcata [plaintiff/defendant] wrote to pay it to it at the latest 1 August 2019 at the latest and that the agreement will be canceled immediately in the event of late payment.
2.12.By letter of 29 July 2019, Delcata has also imposed a fine of € 103,000.00 to [plaintiff/defendant] for violating the contractual purchasing obligation from contract suppliers and [plaintiff/defendant] the amount of € 103,000.00 by return to Delcatato fulfil.Delcata has also stated that if payment is not made and the violation, it will continue to terminate the agreement.
2.13.
Delcata wrote the following to [plaintiff/defendant] on 31 July 2019:
(...)
Unfortunately, we have not yet received any payment from the fine imposed in connection with the violation of Article 14.1.For that reason we cancel the agreement immediately.(...) You are urgently requested to hand in the keys at the head office today
(...) "

[plaintiff/defendant] has refused to hand in the keys to Delcata.Without permission or pre -announcement, Delcata then independently evacuated the location of The Döner Shop at Alkmaar station.

The dispute
in the convention
3.1.
[plaintiff/defendant] progresses, in summary:
to declare that Delcata has failed attributably in the fulfillment of the franchise agreement, or has acted unlawfully towards [plaintiff/defendant],
to declare that Delcata is liable for the damage that [plaintiff/defendant] suffers as a result,
conviction of Delcata to compensation, primarily on the basis of a claims budget, and to order Delcata to pay an advance of € 20,000.00 in reference to the claim status procedure,

3.7.
[plaintiff/defendant] defends.
3.8.
The statements of the parties are discussed below, insofar as relevant.
4
The assessment in the convention
4.1.
Between the parties, in Disguils of Delcata on 31 July 2019, the franchise agreement concluded between the parties was legally terminated with immediate effect and the location operated by him was evacuated.
4.2.
In the cancellation letter of 31 July 2019, Delcata has placed the unpaid fine of € 103,000.00 imposed by letter of 29 July (due to the violation of the purchase obligation with the contractually designated suppliers) as the basis for the direct termination of the franchise agreement.In this procedure, however, Delcata has wrongly acknowledged that the payment of the amount of € 103,000.00 was incorrectly claimed.The fact that Sawari has not paid this amount "by return" cannot justify the cancellation.Moreover, the notice and subsequent cancellation of the agreement is contrary to Article 26 of the franchise agreement.After all, the aforementioned article stipulates that the franchisee must first be awarded a period of 30 days to still meet his obligations before the agreement can be terminated.Now that the letter of 29 July 2019 has not been a reasonable term for compliance with [plaintiff/defendant], the cancellation land made by Delcata cannot bear the direct termination as of 31 July 2019 for that reason.
4.3.Delcata has still argued that she has previously sent Sawari a notice of default by letter of 27 February 2019, but that does not make the above.After all, it is certain that Delcata did not follow this notice of default at the time.Apparently she was of the opinion that [plaintiff/defendant] had met his obligations in time (within the set period of 30 days)
.
In the letter of 29 July 2019, Delcata did not refer to this notice of default at all.This letter can therefore not be based on the termination months later (afterwards).
4.4.
Incidentally, [plaintiff/defendant] disputed the receipt of the letter of 27 February 2019 (and other letters) and argued that he no longer lived at the address [address] after September 2018.However, now that it has not been stated nor proved that [plaintiff/defendant] has passed on a change of address to Delcata and, moreover, the aforementioned address in the summons issued on his (in August 2019) as his home address, the court will continue to ignore this defense.
4.5.
Delcata has also argued that [plaintiff/defendant] has also failed to fulfill his obligations in other areas in such a way that Delcata could legally terminate the franchise agreement as of 31 July 2019.However, Delcata cannot benefit this argument, now that Delcata [plaintiff/defendant] has not failed in accordance with the provisions of Article 26.
4.6.
Delcata also states that it was allowed to terminate the franchise agreement immediately because [plaintiff/defendant] has failed to apply for an operating permit.Pursuant to Article 15.5 of the franchise agreement, [plaintiff/defendant] had to have an operating permit.It has been stipulated that the franchise agreement ends with immediate effect if Sawari has not obtained an operating license within six months of the conclusion of the franchise agreement.On 12 March and 11 April 2019, Delcata requested a certified copy of the operating permit and stated that the agreement will be terminated immediately in the absence of this.However, it is certain that Delcata subsequently continued the cooperation with [plaintiff/defendant] without attaching any consequences to the lack of an operating permit.Also in the summons sent to [plaintiff/defendant] on 29 July 2019, no reference is made to the lack of operating permit.The court is therefore of the opinion that in the given circumstances the appeal of delcata on this grounds for termination (to justify the immediate termination as of July 31, 2019) is unacceptable by standards of reasonableness and fairness.All the more so now that the documents submitted show that Delcata had offered a different branch in Haarlem in Haarlem just before that Delcata still to [plaintiff/defendant] (in exchange for the closing of the Alkmaar station).
4.7.
In view of the above, the conclusion must be that Delcata has acted carelessly towards [plaintiff/defendant] by immediately canceling the franchise agreement concluded between the parties and to evacuate the site on 31 July 2019.Sawari is therefore entitled to compensation for the damage he has suffered as a result.The statements for rights claimed in this context will therefore be granted.
4.8.
In the budget of the damage that is eligible for reimbursement, the court will assume a reasonable notice period of 3 months, multiplied by the average profit realized by [plaintiff/defendant].[plaintiff/defendant] states that he achieved an average profit of € 7,000.00 every month.Delcata has disputed this, but its own statements show that [plaintiff/defendant] achieved a turnover of around € 133,000.00 in 2018.After deduction of the 12%franchise allowance of approximately € 16,000.00, a monthly turnover of more than € 13,000 remains, so that an average monthly win of € 7,000.00 does not prevent the court.The court will therefore estimate the damage of [plaintiff/defendant] at € 21,000 (3 x € 7,000).The court will allocate the claim of [plaintiff/defendant] to this amount.Now that the damage in this judgment has already been estimated, the claimed reference to the claim status procedure will be rejected.The demanded penalty payment will also be rejected because a penalty cannot be imposed pursuant to Article 611a (1) of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure in the event of a conviction for payment of a sum of money.
4.9.The claim for the order of Delcata to pay an amount equal to the value of the stock and property that Delcata has included will be rejected now that [plaintiff/defendant] has insufficiently substantiated this part of his claims.
4.10.
Dellcata will be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings as the largely unsuccessful party.The costs on the part of [plaintiff/defendant] are estimated at:
- summons € 86.40
- Registry fee 914.00
- Salary lawyer
1,086.00
(2.0 points × rate € 543.00)
Total € 2,086.40

The assessment in counterclaim
5.1.
Delcata is claiming payment of € 58,866.19 consisting of € 10,000, € 6,050 entrance fees, € 31,926.65 incorrectly granted discounts and € 10,889.54 in arrears.To this end, Delcata refers to the provisions of the franchise agreement concluded between the parties.
5.2.
After Delcata initially imposed [plaintiff/defendant] a fine of € 103,000.00, it now claims payment of a fine of € 10,000.00.According to Delcata, [plaintiff/defendant] forfeited the fine because he has repeatedly violated the purchasing regulation of Article 14 of the franchise agreement by making purchases at the not designated suppliers All Food & Non Food B.V.in Zwanenburg, Catering wholesaler Meledi in Amsterdam and Bakkerij Firat, with several branches throughout the country.Delcata states that [plaintiff/defendant] continued to purchase from the aforementioned suppliers.In connection with this, Delcata has given Sawari in default on 27 February 2019 and to comply with [plaintiff/defendant] within 30 days to comply with the purchasing regulation.However, the invoices and ledger account that Delcata has submitted to substantiation of its statements shows that [plaintiff/defendant] has only placed one order at All Food & Non Food B.V after the expiry of the set period of 30 days.for which an amount of € 363.40 was charged to [plaintiff/defendant] on 23 May 2019.On a turnover achieved in 2018, the court considers one order of € 363.40 too low a violation of the purchase obligation to justify a fine of € 10,000.00.The advanced fine will therefore be rejected.
5.3.
Sawari has not contradicted that he has not paid the entrance fee of € 5000.However, he has argued that Delcata has never claimed this and it is not reasonable to request payment of this after termination of the agreement.This defense fails.With Delcata, the court is of the opinion that there is no prescription, nor it has been found that Delcata has renounced this, so that Sawari is obliged to fulfill this contractual obligation.The claim for payment of this amount will therefore be granted.
5.4.
Delcata also claims reimbursement of discounts that have been granted wrongly granted in total € 31,926.65.Sawari disputes to pay this and argues that it was agreed orally that the discount was permanent and in view of the duration of the survival of the situation, he could trust that the amounts charged monthly were correct.It is certain that Delcata has never made a claim that has been wrongly granted until the end of July 2019, ie for more than a year.In fact, in the invoices drawn up, the discount has always been explicitly awarded in so many words.The court is of the opinion that, under those circumstances, Delcata cannot still claim payment thereof.The claim of Delcata will therefore be rejected for this section.
5.5.
Pursuant to Article 24 of the Franchise Agreement, Delcata is entitled to a franchise allowance on 12% of the turnover achieved by Sawari.[plaintiff/defendant] disputes that Delcata is entitled to a franchise allowance on the turnover he has made through Thuisbezorgd.nl.However, [plaintiff/defendant] has not stated any facts and circumstances from which it can be deduced that agreements have been made between the parties about selling via Thuisbezorgd.nl that deviate from Article 24 of the franchise agreement.[plaintiff/defendant] did not dispute that he achieved a turnover of € 133,390.36 in 2018.Delcata is therefore entitled for 2018 to pay a franchise allowance of € 16.006.84 (€ 133,390.36
X
12%).It is certain that [plaintiff/defendant] in 2018 there an advance amount of € 11,560.32 (9
X
€ 1,284.48), so that Delcata for 2018 is still entitled to a remaining franchise allowance of € 4,446.52.The amount claimed by Delcata of € 2,010.52 to remaining franchise allowance for 2019 will also be allocated, partly in view of the profit made by Sawari in the Convention regarding the profit achieved, if insufficiently substantiated.
5.6.
The court will allocate the statutory interest on the allocated amounts as advanced.
5.7.Since each of the parties as at any point is unsuccessful to consider, the costs of the proceedings will be compensated in the manner to be mentioned below.
6

6.5.

6.9.
declares this judgment so far enforceable in stock,
6.10.
compensates for the costs of this procedure between the parties, in the sense that each party bears its own costs,
