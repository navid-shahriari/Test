Judgement
The court maintains all that has been considered and decided by the aforementioned decision, insofar as it is not considered or decided in this decision.
The father has based his request on the Hague Convention on the civil aspects of international kidnapping of children of 25 October 1980 (hereinafter: the Convention).Although Iran is not a party to the Convention, according to Article 2 of the International Child Abduction Implementation Act (hereinafter: the Implementation Act), this Act also applies in the cases of international kidnapping of children who are not dominated by a treaty.
Pursuant to Article 11, paragraph 1 of the Implementation Act, the Court of The Hague is authorized to take cognizance of all cases with regard to the forced issue of an internationally abducted child to the person who has the authority on it and the return of such a child over the Dutchborder.
The court sees in the provisions of Articles 2 and 13, paragraph 3 of the Implementation Act to apply the rules of the Convention by analogy.
As far as relevant here - the Convention is to ensure the immediate return of children who have been unauthorized to or are held in a Contracting State.The Convention is aiming for the quickly as possible recovery of the situation in which the child was found immediately prior to the kidnapping or retention.A quick recovery of the situation preceding the abduction or permanent position is deemed to limit the harmful consequences for the child.
It is certain that the parents came to the Netherlands as a family on 4 August 2019 as a family and that the mother left the house in [place name] where she stayed together on 22 August 2019 with [minor].Since then, the mother and [minor] have been in the AZC in [place name] The mother applied for asylum on 27 August 2019 for her and [minor] in the Netherlands.
Unauthorized transmission or retention within the meaning of Article 3 of the ConventionThere is unauthorized transmission or unauthorized retention within the meaning of the Convention When the transfer or not returning is contrary to the right of the State in which the child had his habitual residence immediately before his transfer or permanent residence and thisright alone or
It was exercised together at the time of the transfer or not having returned, or would have been exercised if such an event had not taken place (Article 3 of the Convention).
It is not in dispute that [minor] had her habitual residence in Iran immediately before her permanent residence in the Netherlands.Nor is it in dispute that the authority law was actually actually exercised at the time of the retention, or would have been exercised if the retention had not taken place.Now that it is not in dispute that the father has not given permission for the detention in the Netherlands and that the detention of [minor] in the Netherlands was made in violation of the father's authority under Iranian law, the court concludes that theRetention of [minor] in the Netherlands should be regarded as unauthorized within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.
Immediate return within the meaning of Article 12 of the Convention
Pursuant to Article 12, paragraph 1 of the Convention, the immediate return of a child is ordered when less than one year has expired between the transfer or not returning a child and the time of submitting the request to the court.
Now that less than one year has elapsed between the adoption of [minor] in the Netherlands and the time of submission of the request, the court does not belong to whether - and the mother's position is - [minor] in the Netherlandsrooted and in principle must follow the immediate return of [minor], unless there is one or more grounds for refusal as referred to in Article 13 of the Convention.
The mother argued that there is grounds for refusal, as referred to in Article 13, paragraph 1, sub b and Article 20 of the Convention.
Ground for refusal pursuant to Article 13, paragraph 1, sub b of the Convention
The mother states that on returning to Iran, [minor] will be in an unbearable state and sets the following for substantiation.An incident occurred on August 17, 2019, in which [minor] and themselves were seriously abused by the father.The reason for this incident was that [minor] was crying.The mother states that the father kicked [minor] and stood with his knee on her throat.She also states that the father hit her in the face, so that her nose was relieved and started to bleed heavily.She had herself treated for this in the hospital.This incident did not stand on its own.The father has serious addiction problems, which means he is unable to take care of himself, let alone that he must be able to take care of a minor child.The father also shows unpredictable and aggressive behavior due to his addiction problems.In Iran, the mother was frequently mistreated by the father and [minor] witnessed domestic violence between her parents.The mother did not dare to report domestic violence in Iran, because a woman's report against her husband is not accepted in Iran and is not taken seriously.After treatment in the hospital, the mother pointed out that she can get protection in the Netherlands and she was sent to the IND and the police for reporting.The mother fled with [minor] on August 22, 2019 with the father for safety reasons.The mother has since applied for asylum in the Netherlands and will convert to the Christian faith.Under these circumstances it is no longer possible for the mother to return to Iran.Because the man in Iran has started legal proceedings against the family of the woman, with the statement that the family has encouraged the woman to convert to Christianity, the safety of women in Iran is no longer guaranteed.The mother is of the opinion that on return to Iran, [minor] will be exposed to physical or mental danger.[minor] is very anxious for her father and her treating psychologist in the Netherlands that she has had traumas because of the way in which the father has treated [minor].In view of his personal problems and his intensive work schedule, the father cannot be able to take care of [minor].The mother, on the other hand, is able to offer [minor] a safe parenting environment in the Netherlands.Under these circumstances there are good reasons to refuse the return to Iran, according to the mother.The father disputes the mother's statements motivated.The parents traveled to the Netherlands for a family visit.The mother consciously seized the holiday to the Netherlands to apply for asylum on omhuse (because: economic) land.There were no relationship problems between the parents when they went to the Netherlands and the father states that he never mistreated the mother and [minor].The injuries that the mother sustained on August 17, 2019 are the result of a fall by bike and the mother also declared that in the hospital herself.The father has a good relationship with his daughter and as far as the mother states that [minor] is anxious to him, she has created this fear herself at [minor].The mother does not stand in the way of requesting the divorce in Iran for the reasons she sets.Furthermore, the father disputes that there is addiction.The father has a good job in Iran and is periodically inspected for this.In support, the father submitted his work contact and a statement from a doctor.He considers himself very able to take care of [minor] if she returns to Iran without her mother.The mother and [minor] have not yet converted to Christianity and only want to do this to be eligible for asylum.In short, according to the father, the mother has nothing to fear when I return to Iran.The father states that he did not report the mother.The father believes that the mother has created a situation through the asylum procedure in which there is a lot of uncertainty about where [minor] can stay and is serious about the living conditions of [minor] in the AZC.The father believes that [minor] should return to Iran, preferably together with the mother.
The special curator spoke with [minor] on behalf of the court to give her a voice in these proceedings.[minor] indicates that she does not like it in Iran and in the Netherlands does.In the Netherlands she has more friends;She wants to be there with her mother.[minor] told the special curator about the violence between her parents and about the fact that her father also hit her.Following her findings, the special curator in her report noted that she did not succeed in speaking [minor] without her mother.[minor] is very focused on her mother.She seems to want to please her mother and it was partly because of this not to determine whether she is authentic about memories.[minor] does not oversee the consequences of the stay in both countries according to the special curator.The image about Iran seems to have been mixed in particular with her desire to stay with the mother.It is clear to the special curator that [minor] has experienced a lot before her age and is now looking for a hold on her mother.It is important for [minor] that there will soon be clarity and good guidance from professionals in what will happen.
The court itself spoke with [minor].[minor] does not want the court to share with her parents what she has told.
The court considers as follows.Pursuant to Article 13, paragraph 1, sub b of the Convention, the judge of the requested State is not obliged to order the return if the person who opposes the return demonstrates that there is a serious risk that the child will be returned by his returnexposed to physical or mental danger, or is brought into an unbearable state in any other way.The judge of the requested state may not consider the strict conditions set in that provision, purely on the basis of his opinion that the interest of the child in the country of origin is less well served than in the land of the requested judge.Moreover, when applying it, he may not anticipate a possible (amendment of a) authority decision by the judge of the country of origin after returning the child.The purpose and scope of the treaty mean that this ground for refusal must be explained restrictively and only be honored in extreme situations.This means that the person who invokes this ground for refusal will have to substantiate this with concrete data.Based on the documents submitted and what has been put forward on the oral treatment, the court finds that the mother suffered injuries on her face on 17 August 2019.According to the mother, the father seriously abused her and [minor], while according to the father there has been a bicycle accident.In view of the different statements of the parents about this and the fact that the mother has made a different statement on the cause of the injury in the hospital, the court cannot determine the circumstances of the injuries in this case.If and insofar as the father would have committed violence against the mother on 17 August 2019, then that violence is only insufficient to refuse to return, given the restrictive explanation of the ground for refusal.The mother has completely insufficiently substantiated that the stated domestic violence was more than a one -off and is therefore of such a nature that this means that the return of the [minor] to Iran a risk for [minor] as referred to in Article 13 paragraph 2 subB of the HKOV would yield.The court hereby involves that there is nothing to conclude that there has also been domestic violence against the mother and/or [minor] in Iran.The mother did not report any concrete information about this and did not make a report to the father in Iran in this way.The app messages sent by the mother to the father from the reception for asylum seekers do not point out either.These app messages (production 16 on the other hand) start with the mother's doubt about longer stay here or in another country and her desire to return to Iran and end with the message “
If you want I will pick you up in [place name] by bus
".
What [minor] has stated with the special curator about her parents and the situation in Iran, the court cannot attach decisive significance because the special curator [minor] was unable to speak without the presence of the mother and [minor] at theAnswering the questions turned out to be very focused on her mother's response.The fact that the father is addicted and exhibits aggressive or unpredictable behavior has been contradicted by the father and did not substantiate further by the mother.Even for the rest, the mother did not submit any documents to substantiate her statement that [minor] will be in an unbearable state on return to Iran.
Insofar as the mother argues that [minor] will be in an unbearable condition because the mother will not return to Iran with her, the court passes by.The mother has not shown that a return to Iran is not possible.It has not been shown that the mother and [minor] have actually been converted to Christianity or already confessed this belief in Iran.The mother did not say anything about that.The mother's decision not to return to Iran with [minor] is therefore a free choice that should remain for her account and risk.Even in another way, the mother did not make it plausible that on return there is a fear of physical or mental danger to [minor].
Ground for refusal pursuant to Article 20 of the Convention
Pursuant to Article 20 of the Convention, the return of the child may be refused in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Convention if, on the basis of the fundamental principles of the requested State on the protection of human rights and the fundamental freedoms, it would notare allowed.
Finally, the mother appealed to this ground for refusal.The mother argues that the law of [minor] to convert to Christian and the right to actively confess the Christian faith, not respected in Iran and in the Netherlands.Upon return, [minor] will have to become a Muslim in the father's opinion.In addition, the mother in Iran will not get a fair trial if she starts a procedure with regard to authority about [minor] or to enforce interaction with [minor].Finally, the mother states that the law of [minor] to respect for her family life within the meaning of Article 8 of the ECHR is being violated because the mother does not get a fair trial in Iran.[minor] will experience psychological or physical damage upon return to Iran.The court first of all states that this provision sees on exceptional cases in which it is demonstrated that the child is in danger of being in the state of origin in the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.The court is of the opinion that the mother has insufficiently substantiated that there is the ground for refusal as mentioned in Article 20 of the Convention.The court has not shown that by allocation of the request for return, the interests of [minor], which is also paramount in cases of international child abduction, is paramount.It has not been shown that [minor] has converted to the Christian faith or that the family in Iran already confessed the Christian faith and was therefore in danger.It was also not shown that the mother in Iran could not separate from the father.In the opinion of the court, the mother's appeal to this ground for refusal is therefore not successful.
Now that there is no grounds for refusal as referred to in Articles 13 (1) (b) and 20 of the Convention and it has not been shown that there has been one of the other refusal grounds mentioned in Article 13 of the Convention - the mother has thisAlso no appeal - while less than a year has elapsed between the unauthorized security of [minor] and the submission of the petition, must follow the immediate return of [minor] pursuant to Article 12, paragraph 1 of the Convention.The father has requested that [minor] returned to the address of her parental home.The court is of the opinion that return to a specific address is not in line with the nature and scope of the Convention.The question where Iran [minor] will live must be answered by the competent court there.The court will therefore ignore the father's request to restore [minor] to a specific address in Iran.
Executable in stock
Pursuant to Article 13, paragraph 5 of the Implementation Act, any appeal suspends the implementation of the decision, unless the court provides otherwise in the interest of the child on request or ex officio.The court considers it desirable that [minor] can await any decision on appeal in the Netherlands and will reject the father's request to declare the decision enforceable in stock.The court will order the return on Monday 27 January 2020, being the third working day after the end of the period within which an appeal can be made against the present decision.
Strong arm
The father requests the return of [minor] to order the strong arm if necessary.Pursuant to Article 13 paragraph 6 of the Implementing Act in conjunction with Article 813 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the possibility of implementing the decision with the help of the strong arm is legally provided for.The relevant request from the father will therefore be rejected in the absence of interest.
Cost
The father asks to determine that the mother must pay the costs incurred by him in connection with the kidnapping and the return of [minor] to him.The father states that his costs consist of the court fees and twice the travel costs of Iran to the Netherlands for the directing session, the cross border mediation and the substantive treatment.
The mother has not objected to this.
The court considers that on the basis of Article 26, paragraph 4 of the Convention and Article 13, paragraph 5 of the Implementation Act, the mother, if necessary, can be ordered to pay the necessary costs incurred by the Father in connection with the retreat and return of [[minor].The father did not specify the travel costs he has incurred.In this and in the circumstance that it concerns a family business, the court sees reason to compensate for the costs between the parties.
Special curator
The court considers it in the interest of [minor] that the special curator discusses the decision of the court (and possibly the decision of the Court of Appeal) with her.For the sake of completeness, the court notes that the appointment of the special curator, insofar as an appeal is lodged against this decision, goes through during the appeal procedure.If no appeal is lodged, the court will consider the work of the special trustee to be terminated one month after the date of this decision.
Decision
The court:
orders the return of the minor:
- [minor] born on [date of birth] 2013 in [birthplace], Iran;To Iran where the mother [minor] has to return to Iran and orders, if the mother fails to return [minor] to Iran, that the mother [minor] with the required valid travel documents will issue to the father at the latest on January 272020, so that the father [minor] can take back to Iran;
determines that the parties each bear their own litigation costs;
rejects the lake or otherwise requested;
considered - insofar as no appeal is lodged against this decision - the work of the special curator for this procedure as terminated as of 8 February 2020.
This decision was given by Mrs.J.Th.W.van Ravenstein, H.M. Boone and L. Koper, judges, also juvenile judges, assisted by K. Willems as clerk, and pronounced at the public hearing of 8 January 2020.
From this decision - as far as definitively has been decided - an appeal can be lodged within two weeks (Article 13, paragraph 7 of the International Child Affairs Implementation Act) after the day of the decision by submitting a notice of appeal at the Registry of the Court of Appeal The Hague.In the event of an appeal, the hearing will take place at the Court - in principle - in the third or fourth week after this decision.
