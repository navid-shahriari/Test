The assessment of the appeal
introduction
3.1
[appellant] responded to a vacancy for beautician at Tulip at her location in Amersfoort.The profile of the function includes: “
Completed MBO Beautician training
".After a job interview, an employment contract for the duration of six months was concluded between the parties, starting on October 1, 2019, in which [appellant] joined as a beautician at a gross monthly salary of € 1,525.34.Tulip wrote in an e-mail message of 30 September 2020 that, if [appellant] would not send a copy of her original diploma within a week, she had to say goodbye to [appellant].It explains that Tulip is a registered clinic and may not accept staff without a diploma, because she can get a fine for that.[appellant] reported sick on 8 October 2019.After there has been (mail) contact between the parties, the lawyer [appellant] engaged by Tulip by e-mail from 8.33 pm on 15 October 2019 reported that [appellant], as it was previously reported, until October 16, 2019 9.00 amwas given the opportunity to submit her diploma and that she would otherwise be fired with immediate effect.By e-mail message of 16 October 2019 at 9.10 am, this lawyer immediately dismissed [appellant] on behalf of Tulip.The first sentences of that e-mail are: “You have not submitted your diploma within the stipulated period.This makes it impossible for you to work at Tulip.Tulip will then proceed with immediate dismissal. "[appellant] has a “the same day at 15.50
Certificate
”, Issued by the Education Institute CVO Miras in Kortrijk (hereinafter: the certificate), sent to the Tulip lawyer.
3.2
In the contested decision, the subdistrict court judge considered that the dismissal was immediately given of 16 October 2019 and that there is an urgent reason.The subdistrict court judge has therefore legally judged the dismissal and rejected the requests of [appellant].The Court of Appeal will discuss the objections of [appellant] against the decision, as stated in the complaints in the appeal.[appellant] withdrew her request to pay wages for course days and hours worked prior to 1 October 2019.The appeal procedure therefore only concerns legal validity of the immediate dismissal.
fired immediately
3.3Tulip has dismissed [appellant] with immediate effect because she did not submit her diploma within the set period.[appellant] has not expressed any objections to the judgment of the subdistrict court judge that the immediate dismissal was given immediately, so that the Court of Appeal will appeal.[appellant] takes the position that the period offered for submitting the diploma is unreasonable and that the short exceeding (a few hours) means that an urgent reason, both objectively and subjectively, is not there.The Court of Appeal rejects that statement and judges the immediate dismissal legally.
3.4
The position of [appellant] implies that she believes that she has met Tulip's request to submit her diploma with the submission of the certificate.The court does not share that vision.It is paramount that Tulip from [appellant] was allowed to ask to demonstrate by submitting her diploma that she has an MBO diploma Beauty Specialist (or similar training).Even if Tulip first requested the e-mail of 30 September 2019 to submit the diploma, as [appellant] only disputes Tulip, this is a reasonable request.[appellant] acknowledges that she knew that she had to have completed a training for beautician for the position, as is also stated in the vacancy text, and that is therefore certain between the parties.The period for submitting the diploma was initially set by Tulip a week and then extended.The lawyer engaged by Tulip then gave [appellant] a final period until October 16, 2019 9:00 am.Before the expiry of that period, [appellant] sent nothing, but with the sending of the certificate a few hours later, [appellant] still did not provide a diploma to Tulip.The certificate states that [appellant] obtained partial certificates in school year 2004/2005, namely a partial certificate makeup (for which 100 credits (LT) were awarded) and a partial certificate (for which a total of 320 credits were awarded).[appellant] said during the hearing that she did the entire Beauty Care TSO3 course in Belgium and that she has obtained the diploma for it.The schematic overview attached to the certificate that the TSO3 Beauty Care diploma consists of a total study load of 1160 credits.That is also mentioned on the certificate “
(Total training 1160 LT)
".It is therefore no more to be deduced from the certificate than that [appellant] obtained some subjects (worth 420 credits instead of the 1160 diploma required for the diploma).This means that by sending the certificate on 16 October 2019, [appellant] did not comply with the request for sending her diploma in the afternoon.[appellant] did not therefore have paid no documents other than the certificate in this procedure prior to the dismissal, but not after that (also in this procedure) also fulfilled the reasonable request of Tulip to submit her diploma.Partly in view of the great importance that Tulip has to work with qualified beauticians, this course of course provides an urgent reason, which means that Van Tulip cannot reasonably be expected to have the employment contract continue.
3.5
This means that the cancellation is not contrary to the provisions of Article 7: 671, paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code.In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the subdistrict court judge rightly rejected the requests of [appellant].
4
Conclusion
4.1
The appeal fails and will be rejected.
4.2
[appellant] is ordered as the unsuccessful party ordered in the costs of the appeal procedure.These costs are set on the Tulip side at € 760 in court fees and € 2,148 (2 points rate II) in salary for the lawyer.
