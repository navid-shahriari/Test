The procedure
1.1.
The course of the procedure is evident from:
- the process entry of 11 April 2019;
- the incidental claim for security proceedings costs of 3 June 2019;
- The defense in the incident of 11 June 2019.
1.2.
Finally, judgment was determined in the incident.

The assessment in the incident
2.1.
[plaintiff] claims the conviction of [defendant] to provide certainty for proceedings, estimated at € 2,750.00, whereby if this is not fully or timely (within four weeks) (of which evidence must be submitted), the court [defendant] will declare in admissible in his (head) claims, at least these claims otherwise, for all substantive resources on the defendant [plaintiff], under order [defendant] to pay the costs of the incidental procedure and [plaintiff], aftertimely security by [defendant], period to be given to substantive respondation (in the event of an answer/defense), and thus determining a date for this, according to a judgment in this incident.
2.2.
[plaintiff] bases his claim on the fact that [defendant] has no place of residence nor a habitual place of residence in the Netherlands and for that reason under Article 224 (1) of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure, it is to provide security for the costs of payment for payment of which [defendant] could be convicted.[plaintiff] estimates these costs of proceedings at € 2,750.00, including the court fees, costs of execution and liquidation rate.[plaintiff] adds that the exception grounds included in Article 224 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure do not apply.
2.3.
[defendant] defends.The statements of the parties are discussed below, insofar as relevant.
2.4.
There is no dispute between the parties that [defendant] has no place of residence nor a habitual residence in the Netherlands.[defendant] also indicates, when the parties in his defense in the incident, he himself lives in Iran.In connection with this, there is a situation as referred to in Article 224, paragraph1, of the Code of Civil Procedure, which entails that the claim of [plaintiff] is in principle allocable unless there is an exceptional ground as described in Article 224 paragraph 2 DCCP.
2.5.
[Defendant] bases his defense on the exception of exception as described under d of Article 224 (2) of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure that the obligation to security would lead to an obstacle to the judicial process.This obstacle would exist as a result of the fact that because of the applicable sanctions against Iran it is not possible for him to issue a bank guarantee.In addition, [defendant] argues that [plaintiff] has no interest in asking for certainty because, as [defendant]], the evidence towards [plaintiff] is so conclusive that security is completely unnecessary.Finally, he argues that the costs of the proceedings are too high and insufficiently substantiated.
2.6.
The court is of the opinion that [defendant] has insufficiently substantiated that it is impossible for him to have a bank guarantee for him as a result of the sanctions against Iran.Apart from the fact that in addition to issuing a bank guarantee, other forms of certainty are conceivable, it has also been insufficiently stated that obtaining certainty in the Netherlands based on these sanctions measures or on the basis of other (administrative or financial) reasons problematic, PenibelAnd practically not possible or difficult to implement.There is therefore no reason to assume that the effective access to the court for [defendant] is limited by condemning him to provide certainty.
2.7.The proposition taken by way of a defense that [plaintiff] has no interest in asking for certainty because the evidence towards him is irrefutable, so that security is not necessary is passed by the court.This defense of [defendant] in fact involves an assessment of what has been stated and claimed in the main proceedings and falls outside the framework within which the court must judge the incident raised.
2.8.
[plaintiff] has failed to provide proper insight into the way in which he has determined the amount and composition of the amount of costs of proceedings by him.For the proceedings to be issued in the main proceedings, the court takes as the starting point the registry fee due on the part of [plaintiff] that, upon allocation of the addition requested, is set at € 81.00 and, based on a further courseWithout complications, for salary lawyer € 2,085.00 (3 points based on rate III of € 695.00 per point in accordance with the applicable liquidation rate).Thus, the costs of the proceedings for which security must be provided are estimated at € 2,166.00.
2.9.
[defendant] will be ordered to provide certainty in the way specified in Article 6:51 of the Dutch Civil Code, whereby [plaintiff] will therefore be able to recover without difficulty on the security offered, for an amount of € 2,166.00.A period of four weeks before providing security, as [plaintiff] has demanded, the court is reasonable.The court will therefore determine that [defendant] must provide security within four weeks of the date of this judgment.
2.10.
The court considers terms to be present to maintain a decision regarding the costs of the incident and at the same time with the decision regarding the costs of the main proceedings.
2.11.
In the main proceedings, this will be further litigated in the position in which it is located.[plaintiff] is given the opportunity to submit his statement of defense four weeks after the outer date.
2.12.
The court also maintains every decision.
