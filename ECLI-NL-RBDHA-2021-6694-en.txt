Asylum application be taken out of handling on the basis of Article 30c, first paragraph, opening words and under a and b, Vw.
It is not in dispute that the claimant has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and that he suffers from psychoses.Among other things, he has hallucinations and voices in his head and uses medication.The medical file submitted by the claimant, and not disputed by the defendant, also shows that the plaintiff has been missing several times in the past, that no one knows where he was staying during those periods and that he has repeatedly missed agreements with practitioners.
The court considers that the defendant has rightly taken as a starting point that it is primarily up to the foreign national to make his asylum account plausible.This does not alter the fact that the defendant must make an effort throughout the procedure and ensure whether a foreign national needs special procedural guarantees.This requires an active attitude of the defendant.The court hereby involves point 29 of the Considerans and Article 24 of the procedural directive [1], which have been converted into Article 3,108b of the VB [2].In this context, the court points to the decision of the Department of 26 August 2020 (

), in which it was considered that, after an asylum application has been made, the defendant must check whether a foreign national needs special procedural guarantees for the investigation into that application.If this is the case, but some form of hearing is possible, the defendant must offer appropriate support during the investigation.This also follows from work instruction 2015/8 "special procedural guarantees".
In the opinion of the court, in the case of the plaintiff, the defendant has not carefully prepared himself and has not properly substantiated the position that it is attributed to the claimant that he has not appeared on hearing several times and that he has insufficient information about hishas provided the application.The defendant should have investigated other, appropriate forms of information gathering, taking into account the psychological disorder of the plaintiff.In the opinion of the court, the defendant is in this case the duty to make an extra effort to give the claimant the opportunity to raise his account.For example, it could have been investigated whether the defendant could have heard the plaintiff on location, so in the asylum seekers' center where he is staying, or could otherwise consult with the plaintiff's authorized representative.In view of the course of this procedure and the psychological and medical circumstances of the plaintiff, the court is of the opinion that the defendant's reasons is not sufficient in this case.The statement that it had been on the plaintiff's authorized representative to raise these options (again) does not detract from the foregoing.The professional ground succeeds.

Consideration
Introduction
1. The plaintiff has the Iranian nationality and was born on [date of birth].
2. The court assumes the following.Plaintiff submitted his first asylum application on December 30, 2015.The defendant rejected this application on 30 May 2017 as unfounded on the basis of Article 31 of the Vw
1
.Plaintiff has appealed against this decision.By judgment of 23 October 2017, this appeal was declared inadmissible because it turned out that the plaintiff had left with an unknown destination since 15 June 2017.
3. On January 12, 2019, the plaintiff submitted this application.It follows from the process file that the defendant decided on 22 February 2019 to send the plaintiff's asylum application to the extended asylum procedure.Plaintiff was then invited on 22 May 2019, 12 June 2019 and 26 June 2019 to appear for an appointment at the FMMU on medical advice.All these times the plaintiff has not appeared.Plaintiff has been in [name] from about the end of June for a few months.
On November 26, 2019, the FMMU found that the plaintiff has psychological complaints, but that they are not so serious that this will result in restrictions in hearing and deciding.The hearing then could not take place afterwards.The hearing of January 9, 2020 was canceled at the request of the plaintiff's authorized representative, because the plaintiff was unable to travel independently to the registration center [location 1].
On November 23, 2020, another FMMU Advies was issued, in which it was found that the claimant can be heard, provided that his psychological circumstances are taken into account.Plaintiff did not appear on the appointment for his hearing on 11 March 2021.The plaintiff appeared on March 30, 2021, but the medical service of the registration center (AC) [location 2] found that the plaintiff was mentally unable to be heard.
On April 17, 2021, again an FMMU advice was issued, in which it is advised that the claimant is able to be heard if certain restrictions are taken into account.On May 4, 2021, the plaintiff again did not appear on the planned hearing.The defendant then, after a few times have been tried to contact the plaintiff's authorized representative, issued the intention on the same day to put the application out of treatment.Plaintiff submitted his opinion on this on 13 May 2021.The defendant took this decision on 19 May 2021.
Decision
5. The defendant has taken out the asylum application from the claimant on the basis of Article 30c, first paragraph, opening words and under a and b, Vw.Pursuant to these provisions, the defendant can put an application out of handling within the meaning of Article 28 of the procedural directive, if the foreign national has failed to answer requests to provide information that is essential for his application (a) and the foreign national notHas been published by an hearing and he has not shown within a period of two weeks that this cannot be attributed to him (B).
Grounds
6. The plaintiff argues that the defendant wrongly explained his asylum application.He has sufficiently substantiated that he was unable to appear independently, without any support, by hearing with the defendant.The plaintiff has a lot of trouble complying with agreements in view of his psychological condition.The file clearly shows that the plaintiff has serious mental problems and has not appeared on agreements several times whether it has appeared, but was unable to be heard.At the hearing, the authorized representative of the claimant explained in more detail that, or an office companion, he regularly went with the claimant to an appointment to ensure that the claimant would actually appear at the appointment.The defendant did not do insufficiently careful investigation into the reasons why the plaintiff did not appear.The defendant could also have offered alternatives, such as a hearing at the registration center where the plaintiff is staying.The contested decision does not state why no use was made of this.In addition, the plaintiff was not requested to provide information.
6.1
The defendant follows the claimant that he could not appear on hearing because of his mental problems, not.It is not substantiated that the claimant has no sense of time and place.That is why the claimant could be expected to appear on the date of hearing in [location 1].The FMMU advice of 17 April 2021 shows that the claimant can be heard if the defendant takes into account certain restrictions.The FMMU advice is an expert advice that the defendant can assume.The statement that the claimant is unable to appear independently, without any form of support, because he is unreachable (for his authorized representative) is not followed.The defendant has given the plaintiff the opportunity to be heard several times.Furthermore, the plaintiff not only did not appear before hearing, but he did not use the opportunity to make relevant information about his asylum application, or the reason for his absence, either.
Judgment of the court7. The court officially considers that there is the interest of procedure so that the claimant can be received in his appeal.Although the plaintiff of the claimant stated at the hearing that the plaintiff is occasionally without a trace and is not known where he is staying, but it is not in dispute that the plaintiff is registered in the asylum seekers' center in [place] and has not left with an unknown destination.The claimant of the claimant has contact with the claimant's brother, who is staying in the Netherlands.
8. It is not in dispute that the claimant has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and that he suffers from psychoses.Among other things, he has hallucinations and voices in his head and uses medication.The medical file submitted by the claimant, and not disputed by the defendant, also shows that the plaintiff has been missing several times in the past, that no one knows where he was staying during those periods and that he has repeatedly missed agreements with practitioners.
9. The court considers that the defendant has rightly taken as a starting point that it is primarily up to the foreign national to make his asylum account plausible.This does not alter the fact that the defendant must make an effort throughout the entire procedure and make sure that a foreign national needs special procedural guarantees.This requires an active attitude of the defendant.The court hereby involves point 29 of the Considerans and Article 24 of the Procedural Directive

, in which it was considered that the defendant, after an asylum application has been made, must check whether a foreign national needs special procedural guarantees for the investigation into that application.If this is the case, but some form of hearing is possible, the defendant must offer appropriate support during the investigation.This also follows from work instruction 2015/8 "special procedural guarantees".
10. In the opinion of the court, in the case of the plaintiff, the defendant has not carefully prepared himself and has not properly substantiated the position that it is attributed to the claimant that he has not appeared on hearing several times and that he insufficient informationhas provided his application.After all, it is not in dispute that the claimant has serious psychological problems.The court does not follow the statement at the hearing, which is insufficiently substantiated that the claimant would not have a sense of time and place.In addition, the process file also shows sufficient that the plaintiff has serious psychological problems.The FMMU also has several times
5
Determined that the claimant could not be heard attention to his medical problems.The fact that the last FMMU advice of April 17, 2021 shows that the plaintiff could be heard, does not alter the fact that just before, on March 30, 2021, the medical service at the AC [location 2] was found that the plaintiff could not be heard.In addition, it follows from the process file and the medical file that it is very difficult to make agreements with the claimant, in view of his medical situation.The defendant should have investigated other, appropriate forms of information gathering, taking into account the psychological disorder of the plaintiff.In the opinion of the court, the defendant is in this case the duty to make an extra effort to give the claimant the opportunity to raise his account.For example, it could have been investigated whether the defendant could have heard the plaintiff on location, so in the asylum seekers' center where he is staying, or could otherwise consult with the plaintiff's authorized representative.The defendant did that in the past, after the claimant was included in the [name] in 2019, as explained at the hearing by the plaintiff.The file also shows that the claimant's brother is very involved and has contact with the plaintiff's authorized representative.In view of the course of the present procedure, as stated above under 3, and the psychological and medical circumstances of the plaintiff, the court is of the opinion that the defendant's reasons in this case is not sufficient.The statement that it had been on the plaintiff's authorized representative to raise these options (again) does not detract from the foregoing.The professional ground succeeds.
11. Insofar as the authorized representative of the claimant (first at the hearing) argued that the claimant's hearing may not be possible in view of his psychological problems, the court considers that the defendant was able to take the position that this statement, in view of the latterFMMU advice, insufficiently substantiated.This professional ground therefore does not succeed.
Conclusion
12. The court concludes that - now that the claimant cannot be blamed for not appearing on 4 May 2021, nor that he could not provide any information about his asylum application - the defendant wrongly asked his asylum application out of handling.13. The appeal is well -founded.The contested decision was taken in violation of Articles 3: 2 and 3:46 of the General Administrative Law Act.The court therefore annulles the contested decision and instructs the defendant to take a new decision with due observance of this decision.The court sets a period of eight weeks after the defendant has heard the claimant or has concluded the investigation.
14. The court condemns the defendant in the costs incurred by the claimant.On the basis of the Decree on the Legal Aid Decree, the court sets these costs at € 1,068 (1 point for submitting the appeal and 1 point before the appearance at the hearing with a value per point of €534 and a weighting factor 1).

- explains the appeal;

- stipulates that the defendant must take a new decision on the claimant's application within eight weeks after the defendant has heard the claimant or has concluded the investigation;
