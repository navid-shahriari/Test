Resume
1.1.
Parties are married by Iranian law.In their marriage certificate they have agreed a bridal gift from 100 Bahar Azadi Golden Coins.[A] claims in the convention transfer of the coins or an equivalent thereof equal to € 50,670.00.[B] claims reimbursement of amounts that he would have paid for [A] in the counterclaim and payment of an amount that his brother has transferred to [A], but what would be intended for him.
1.2.
The court finds that the Dutch court has jurisdiction and that Iranian law applies to the matrimonial property regime of the parties.The woman's right to claim a bridal gift under Iranian law is generally recognized in the Netherlands.The defenses of [B] that [A] cannot claim the bridal gift because there is deception, abuse of circumstances or error, or because it has renounced it by initiating a divorce, do not hold.The same applies to the defenses of [B] that the bridal gift has fallen in the marriage community or that the bridal gift is recovering or must be moderate.The claim in the convention is therefore granted.The claim in the counterclaim has been disputed by [A] and is rejected as insufficiently motivated.

The procedure
2.1.
The course of the procedure is evident from:
- the interlocutory judgment of November 25, 2022, whereby a comparison of the parties has been determined,
- the conclusion of answer in counterclaim,
- the deed increase in the requirement of [B],
- the translation of production 2 of [B], submitted by B form of 12 January 2023,
- The oral treatment of January 30, 2023, of which notes were made by the clerk.
2.2.
Finally, a judgment was determined.

The assessment in the convention
The dispute
3.1.
Parties both have Iranian nationality.They are married in Iran on [date] 2019.The following includes the following:
“The wedding: the woman has received: a copy of the holy Quran, a mirrors, a few candlesticks, moreover one hundred / 100 full Bahar Azadi gold coins, which the man serves when this is claimed by woman, in the whole of the womanto be transferred."
3.2.
[B] lives in the Netherlands and returned to the Netherlands after the marriage.On December 19, 2019, [A] arrived in the Netherlands via family reunification.The following day she reported [B] of domestic violence and left his home.Since then, parties have not seen each other anymore.
3.3.
[A] is now claiming (primary) transfer of the bridal gift from a hundred Bahar Azadi Gold Coins or (alternatively) an equivalent thereof equal to € 50,670.00.When assessing that claim, it is first of all important whether (1) the Dutch court is competent (has jurisdiction) and (2) which law applies.
Jurisdiction
3.4.
[B] states that [A] should have submitted its claim to the Iranian court.Insofar as he means to state that the Dutch court is not competent, the court considers the following.
3.5.
The Dutch court has jurisdiction if the defendant has his place of residence or habitual residence in the Netherlands.This is stated in Article 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
3.6.
[B] lives in the Netherlands.The Dutch court therefore has jurisdiction and is authorized to judge this dispute.
Applicable law
3.7.The Convention on the Law that applies to the matrimonial property regime The Hague (also called: The Hague Marriage Convention 1978, hereinafter: HHV) determines what right applies to the matrimonial property regime between [A] and [B].Article 4 of the preamble and paragraph 3 of the HHV states that if spouses have not designated the applicable law before their marriage, and they will not establish their first habitual residence after marriage in the territory of the same state, their matrimonial property regime is governed by the internal law of thestate of their common nationality.
3.8.
It has not been stated or proved that the parties have indicated before their marriage what right applies to their matrimonial property regime.It is certain that the parties did not start living together immediately after their marriage.[A] has stayed in Iran and [B] left for the Netherlands.Since parties both had the Iranian nationality at the time of marriage, Iranian law applies to their matrimonial property regime.The parties also agree on that.
Wedding
3.9.
It is established between the parties that they are married under Iranian law, that they have concluded a marriage certificate and that a bridal gift has been agreed from one hundred Bahar Azadi Golden Coins.The marriage certificate between the parties also shows that the bridal gift must be transferred by [B] as soon as [A] claims it.The woman's right to claim a bridal gift under Iranian law is generally recognized in the Netherlands.[B] takes the position that he does not have to pay the bridal gift.To this end, he led the following four defenses.
1) Deception, abuse of circumstances or error
3.10.
[B] takes the position that [A] cannot claim the bridal gift, because there is deception, at least abuse of circumstances by [A] or error on his side when the marriage is entering into.According to [B], [A] is only married to him to come to the Netherlands through family reunification and to build a life of its own here, regardless of him.[A] disputes this.
3.11.
The court does not follow the defense of [B].To this end, it is important that, since Iranian law applies, [B] wrongly appeals to Dutch provisions on fraud, abuse of circumstances and error.[A] has argued that these provisions in Iranian law do not exist.[B] did not substantiate his appeal on this point.In addition, it is important that, apart from the question of whether Iranian law there may be a lack of will or the lack of consensus as a result of which the provision of the bridal gift could be void or voidable, [B] has insufficiently substantiated his appeal on this.[B] has not sufficiently substantiated that [A] only entered into the marriage to obtain a residence permit.The few circumstances that the parties only lived together in the Netherlands, that [A] subsequently reported domestic violence, that [B] was acquitted, and that [A] subsequently applied for an independent residence permit, are insufficiently to that conclusionto come.This could also all be the case if [A] had no preconceived plan and [B] did not substantiate the existence.It did not show that [B] did not know what obligation he entered with the bridal gift.After all, the marriage certificate shows that a notary explained to the parties mentioned in the marriage certificate when entering into the marriage.This defense of [B] will therefore be ignored.
2) Quoted from bridal gift by separation
3.12.
In addition, [B] states that [A] is not entitled to the bridal gift, because she has taken the initiative for divorce and has therefore renounced the bridal gift.Although no divorce has been pronounced yet, [B] has actually left his home forever and there is therefore a separation under Iranian law.Since [A] has taken the initiative for this, according to [B] there is a "khul" separation and she must renounce the bridal gift.
3.13.The court does not follow [B] here.There is a Khul separation if the woman wants to separate and there is no valid reason for the divorce (under Iranian law).The man must then give permission for the divorce, and in practice he can ask in exchange that the woman is renouncing the bridal gift.This case has not shown that a divorce has already been requested or pronounced.It has also not been shown that the parties have agreed that [A] renounces the bridal gift in exchange of the permission of [B] for a divorce.The report submitted by [A] of the International Legal Institute (IJI) also shows that the payout of the bridal gift under Iranian law is not dependent on factors in the behavior of women during marriage or in its method of fulfillmentof the marital duties.In the opinion of the court, the circumstance that [A] has left the home of [B] (definitively) does not mean that she has renounced the bridal gift.
3) Bridal gift in the marriage community
3.14.
[B] further states that the bridal gift fell into the marital community of the parties, so that [A] can only claim half of the bridal gift.He hereby refers to the ruling of the Arnhem-Leeuwarden Court of 4 May 2021 (ECLI: NL: Gharl: 2021: 4341).
3.15.
The court considers that in the aforementioned Dutch law decision applied to the matrimonial property regime of the parties involved, while the matrimonial property regime of [B] and [A] Iranian law applies.Iranian matrimonial property law has an exclusion from every community of property.This means that everything that the parties had when entering into marriage and everything they acquire during the marriage is and remains private property.Parties have not included a clause in the marriage certificate that shows something else.The court therefore does not follow [B] in his defense that the bridal gift would have fallen in the marriage community.
4) Insufficient financial capacity
3.16.
Finally, [B] states that he has insufficient financial capacity to pay the bridal gift.He receives an IVA benefit, is exempt from work and also has no large assets.According to [B], the size of the bridal gift, given its low capacity, is contrary to reasonableness and fairness and the bridal gift must therefore be recovered or moderate.
3.17.
The court considers that financial impotence in general does not stand in the way of the allocation of a claim.In addition, the appeal of [B] cannot succeed on the Dutch doctrine of reasonableness and fairness, since Iranian law applies to the matrimonial property regime of the parties.The aforementioned IJir report shows that there is no general legal principle or correction mechanism within Iranian law, such as the Dutch doctrine of reasonableness and fairness, on the basis of which the bridal gift can be recovered or adapted because of the man's financial situation.However, the IJI report that under Iranian law applies that if a bridal gift is higher than one hundred and ten (110) Bahar Azadi Golden Coins, legal proceedings must be conducted.A different decision can then be made about the surplus (above one hundred and ten coins), taking into account the capacity and the ability of the man.However, the woman retains the right to a bridal gift of one hundred and ten Bahar Azadi Golden Coins.In this case, the bridal gift is a hundred Bahar Azadi gold coins and [B] under Iranian law is therefore not entitled to reassuring or moderation of the bridal gift.
3.18.
In addition, the court reads in the defense of [B] that [B] actually appeals that he has no decision on a hundred Bahar Azadi Golden Coins.That was not contradicted by [A].Because a party cannot be ordered to transfer something that it does not have, the court will reject the primary claim and order [B] to pay the alternative amount of amounts of € 50,670.00.It is important that [B] did not defend the statement of [A] that this amount is equal to the agreed one hundred Bahar Azadi Golden Coins.
Conclusion
3.19.
The court comes to the next conclusion.Because the parties in the marriage certificate have agreed a bridal gift of one hundred Bahar Azadi Golden Coins, [A] can, in the opinion of the court, claim that, and [B] has not disputed that one Bahar Azadi gold coin represents a value of € 506,70 the court will assign the claim of [A] to pay € 50,670.00.
Proceedings
3.20.Due to the (former) relationship between parties, the costs - as usual in family affairs - will be compensated.This means that each party bears its own costs.In the statement of [B] that he has been summoned rawly, the court sees no reason to deviate from this principle.The lawyer of [B] stated during the hearing that [B] had already announced to [A] that he did not agree with the claim and would not transfer the coins or payment of a comparable amount.

The assessment in counterclaim
The progress of [B]
4.1.
states that he - when [A] still lived in Iran - advanced various amounts for her, including the costs of a set of gold jewelry, the costs of a car (from the MVM brand, model 110, year of construction 2015, color white) andThe costs of eye surgery.He also states that at the request of [A] he transferred an amount of € 500.00 to her aunt's bank account before her departure, because [A] needed money to purchase her flight ticket and for a number of unpaid billsto pay.In addition, the brother of [B] transferred an amount of € 1,000.00 to the bank account of [A].According to [B], it was intended that [A] would give this amount to him on arrival in the Netherlands, but she did not.[B] states that [A] must repay these amounts on the basis of undue payment or unjust enrichment.
4.2.
[A] disputes that the payments for gold jewelry, a car or eye surgery have been made.She argues that she does not recognize the aforementioned payments.In the opinion of the court, it had been on the road of [B] because of this dispute to further substantiate his positions.After all, nowhere does it show that [B] actually paid the amounts mentioned.In addition, the fact that the parties are now apart does not mean that amounts that [B] paid during or prior to the marriage have been unduly or unjustly enriched.With regard to the transfers, [B] has submitted transfer certificates.Nowhere, however, it appears that the transferred amounts for [A] or for [B] were intended.In the opinion of the court, [B] has therefore insufficiently substantiated his statements.His claims will therefore be rejected.
Proceedings
4.3.
The proceedings in the counterclaim will - in view of the (former) relationship between the parties - be compensated in the sense that each party bears its own costs.
