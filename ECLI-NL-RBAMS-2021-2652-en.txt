Further course of the procedure
An interim judgment was made on December 15, 2020.In the execution of that intermediate judgment, [plaintiff] has taken a deed with productions, to which Vesteda responded.Subsequently, [plaintiff] commented on the latter deed and submitted further productions, after which Vesteda responded by deed.
Subsequently, a date for judgment was determined.
Grounds of the decision
Judgement
The interlocutory judgment of 15 December 2020 stipulates that the decision will be held pending the decision of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in the case between [plaintiff] and [name 1].[plaintiff] brought the judgment to be issued on December 22, 2020.In short, it means that the Court of Appeal confirms the decision of the subdistrict court judge.
Vesteda argues in its deed of 16 February 2021 that the decision of the subdistrict court judge for arrest is legally and factually incorrect.It would be a surprise decision and the judgment would not be relevant to the issue to be decided in this case.The subdistrict court judge cannot follow Vesteda in this.There is a surprise decision when the judge, without the parties being the opportunity to respond to it, takes a decision in legal grounds he has completed.This is not the case here.The decision to arrest is intended to be able to take cognizance of a decision relevant according to the subdistrict court judge and [plaintiff] has been given the opportunity to bring this decision into the proceedings.Such a decision belongs to the instruction authority of the treating court and is in line with the provisions of Article 22 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure. There is no question of supplementing legal grounds.This does not alter the fact that a possible decision to arrest during the oral treatment was not discussed.Finally, the subdistrict court judge is of the opinion of the aforementioned judgment, contrary to what Vesteda believes, is relevant for the issue to be decided in this case, as will still be apparent from the following.
3. It was considered in the interlocutory judgment of 15 December 2020 that the claim of [plaintiff] does not comply with the condition of Article 7: 267 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code that this must be established jointly by the tenant and the intended co-tenant.In the judgment of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal of 22 December 2020, the decision of the subdistrict court judge of 10 March 2920 is confirmed that [name 1] is obliged to cooperate in obtaining co -tenancy of [plaintiff] from the lessor Vesteda.Vesteda argues that this decision does not relate to the subsequent phase of a procedure at the subdistrict court judge.Strictly speaking, Vesteda is right on her side, but the subdistrict court judge goes beyond for the next reason.The position of Vesteda means that [plaintiff] should again be in law for this next phase [name 1] to enforce his cooperation.In the opinion of the subdistrict court judge, such a procedure, in view of the earlier decisions of Subdistrict Court and Court of Appeal, would have a predictable result, because it still has as a starting point that the subdistrict court judge considered in rov 11 of the judgment of 10 March 2020 andThe Court of Appeal in ROV 3.9 has confirmed: "Against this background, the Court of Appeal with the subdistrict court judge is of the opinion that the rental right is jointly entitled to the parties in their mutual relationship and that they in principle have equal rights with regard to the home."Under these circumstances, the subdistrict court judge considers the provisions of the condition of a joint request from the tenant and the intended co -tenant in violation of reasonableness and fairness.Incidentally, this outcome is in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court of 13 November 1987 NJ 1988/254.The requirement that it is stated there now that it is a provision of mandatory law and that a cautious use of it is appropriate has been met, in view of the special circumstances of the present case, which circumstances in the earlier procedures between [plaintiff] and[name 1] have been extensively discussed.
4. Subsequently, the question is whether [plaintiff] meets the conditions of Article 7: 267 paragraph 3 of the Dutch Civil Code.
5. The condition of having a main residence in the relevant living space of at least two years has been met.As is also considered in the judgment of the Court of Appeal of December 22, 2020, [plaintiff] was in any case withdrawn by [name 1] at the end of 2016 and that the circumstance that she has not become a co -tenant is not based on an appointment or a conscious choice of[name 1] and [plaintiff].She subsequently lived there with [name 1] together at the end of August of 2019 and had the main residence.
6. The condition that [plaintiff] has also conducted a joint household with [name 1] is in the opinion of the subdistrict court judge.Documents submitted by [plaintiff] in the proceedings, including a statement of defense submitted on behalf of [name 1] in an alimony issue, it can be deduced that [name 1] was fully incapacitated for work as a result of an accident 2 July 2015 and failureNo more income of disability insurance.This is also confirmed by statements submitted by the Tax Authorities on the registered income of [name 1] for 2016 and 2017 of € 56.00 and € 0. [plaintiff] and [name 1], according to a statement on behalf of [name 1] in the same statement of defense, of a benefit set in the name of [plaintiff], supplemented with a child -related budget that [plaintiff] received.In addition, [plaintiff] has submitted documents that can be concluded that she contributed to the household to a significant extent.The subdistrict court judge refers to the fact that she met the rent to Vesteda several times, that she made purchase for the household (including the Praxis), an invoice from the Nuon, that the assessment for water board tax for the address 1] onHer name stood and the same applies to the subscription with Feenstra.
7. Subsequently, the question is whether [plaintiff] can be argued that she would no longer stay in the home at the time of the request for co -tenancy.In the opinion of the subdistrict court judge, this is not the case, now that the condition has been met that this request was made as soon as possible after the termination of the cohabitation ((HR 14 August 2015, ECLI: NL: HR: 2015: 2193).On 3 July 2019, when [name 1] and [plaintiff] still lived together, Vesteda rejected a first request from [plaintiff] to co -tenancy (Prod. 2 summons). That rejection based Vesteda on the (apparently: poor) payment behavior of [[apparently: bad) payment behavior [Name 1]. Only when that was in order could a new request be submitted. This made Vesteda a ground for refusal that has not been borrowed from Article 7: 267 of the Dutch Civil Code and thus the wrong leg.[plaintiff] and [name 1] escalated and had to leave the house by order of [name 1] by the end of August 2019 by the end of August 2019. After that, [plaintiff] was the cooperation to make a request through a summary proceedings.to co -tenancy of [name 1], which issue led to a positive decision of the subdistrict court judge on 10 March 2020 for [plaintiff].Subsequently, she (again) turned to Vesteda, which leads to a (final) rejection by e-mail message of 20 March 2020.In view of the foregoing, in the opinion of the subdistrict court, [plaintiff] meets the condition that she has made its request for co -tenancy as soon as possible after the termination of the cohabitation.
8. Vesteda has further argued that the request of [plaintiff] is only aimed at providing the position of the tenant.[plaintiff] has disputed that and pointed out that her request is aimed at obtaining co -tenancy and that she is still confident that she can reconcile with [name 1].The subdistrict court judge finds that [name 1] and [plaintiff] have previously been temporarily separated and that they started living together again.In his opinion, it is therefore not sufficiently established that the request for co -tenancy apparently only has the scope of providing the position of the tenant in the short term.9. Finally, Vesteda has argued that [plaintiff] does not comply with the fixed policy of Vesteda that must be a gross income that has approximately three times the monthly rental (conclusion of answer under 24).The subdistrict court judge is of the opinion that this condition [plaintiff] cannot be invoked either.As can be drawn up from the foregoing, [name 1] had no relevant income when entering into the rent in 2016 and apparently also then also took into account the income generated by [plaintiff], even though her name was not in the lease contractmention.It has neither been stated nor proved that at the time of the cohabitation of [name 1] and [plaintiff] there were rent arrears in the period from 2016 to 2019.Even now, [plaintiff] has its own income and also has, as can be deduced from submitted documents, about any assets under a benefit that it received for a longer period of time in connection with compensation for personal injury.In view of the previous circumstances, [plaintiff] cannot reasonably be ranked that she offers insufficient guarantees for a proper fulfillment of the rent from a financial point of view.
10. The foregoing leads the subdistrict court judge to the conclusion that there are no grounds as referred to in Article 7: 267 paragraph 3 of the Dutch Civil Code to reject the claim of [plaintiff].The claim of [plaintiff] that it will therefore be granted to the [address 1] from the date on which this judgment will be given to the house.
11. If the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings.An addition has been granted to [plaintiff].That is why the clerk were advanced in this case.Due to the lack of a legal basis, a cost order with the obligation to pay to the clerk of the advocated exploitation and/or advertising costs is not possible.
