Born on [Date of birth minor] 2014 in [birthplace minor], hereinafter referred to as [first name minor].
As stakeholders, the juvenile court judge notes:
[name of mother],
After this, the mother, living at a address known to the court.
[name of father],
hereinafter referred to as the father, residing in [Father].
The process of process
The process trend is apparent from the following documents:
- the request with appendices from the Council of 22 February 2021, received at the registry on the same date;
- The council report with appendices from the council of 15 March 2021, received at the registry on the same date.
On March 23, 2021, the juvenile court judge dealt with the case with closed doors at the hearing.
Have been heard:
- The mother assisted by her lawyer A. Hashem Jawaheri-Marquis and Mr.[name of interpreter], interpreter Iranian,
- The father assisted by his lawyer J.M.Neervoort,
- A representative of the council, mrs.[name of representative 1],
- Two representatives of the certified Institution Youth Protection Rotterdam-Rijnmond, hereinafter referred to as: the GI, MW.[name of representative 2] and mrs.[name of representative 3].
The facts
The parental authority about [first name minor] is exercised by the parents.
[first name minor] lives with the mother.
By order of 7 January 2021, [first name minor] was provisionally placed under supervision until 7 April 2021.
The request
The Council has requested the supervision of [first name minor] for the duration of six months.
The Council maintained the request at the hearing and explained as follows.The parents have been apart since 2016.Their communication is not going well, they have a lot of struggle with each other and [first name minor] is in between.The importance of [first name minor] is lost sight of by the parents.Since 2016, no constructive assistance has been used to make it possible for [first name minor].The supervision must ensure that this assistance will get off the ground, that the parents will adhere to agreements and that, for example, through mediation, there will be a form of communication between the parents.After six months you can hopefully transfer to the neighborhood team.
The views
The GI has agreed to the request from the council.There have not yet been joint conversations with the parents.In the meantime, the parents have both indicated that they are open to mediation.This mediation would then take place in the Rotterdam region.The mother has registered [first name minor] with mentally better and there will also be an advice for which assistance is appropriate.In addition, [first name minor] will be registered with "Piep said the mouse".It may be that a period of six months is not sufficient.
By and on behalf of the father, the request of the council has been agreed.The father has a hard time wearing the costs for traveling in the context of the access arrangement and he feels punished as he does his best.Perhaps the mediation can take place in a place between Den Helder and the Rotterdam region.The father has previously asked if he could have been able to handle [first name minor] once a month from Friday to Sunday instead of twice a month, in order to reduce tensions and stressful transfer moments.He was then told that this was not possible and that he would no longer get a handling of [first name minor] at all.In addition, legal proceedings run between the parents who cause a lot of stress.There is such a hardening between the parents that the question is whether mediation is sufficient.Perhaps a certain form of therapy can also be helpful.By and on behalf of the mother, the Council's request has been agreed.The mother is open to help.Nothing has changed in the past two and a half years.The father did not want to incur any costs for traveling then, but the mother does not go to Den Helder because she has been a victim of domestic violence.The mother lives on social assistance benefits and the father does not contribute financially to the education of [first name minor].[first name minor] needs two parents who can communicate with each other.That would be a start.The mother recently started a procedure in connection with the settlement of the bridal gift under Iranian law.
The assessment
The documents submitted and the treatment at the hearing showed that there is a serious development threat in [first name minor].The parents have not been able to communicate with each other in a constructive way for a long time, there are therefore the interests of [first name minor] overlooking many different things.The parents must realize that when this situation continues like this, there is a chance that it will ultimately be decided that [first name minor] can no longer continue to live with the parents.
It is positive that the parents now indicate that they are open to mediation, but given the mutual struggle between the parents, it can be doubted whether this mediation will start and will be effective.Children from the Knel are unfortunately not an option, because there are still procedures running between the parents.The juvenile judge expresses the hope that the GI has opportunities to restore communication between the parents, in order to improve the situation of [first name minor].The fact that the mother has chosen to live far from Den Helder does not make it easier for the assistance.The juvenile court judge is of the opinion that under -supervision is necessary to be able to use appropriate assistance and to ensure that the parents will make decisions together again, which are also in the interest of [first name minor].From the foregoing it follows that the legal criterion mentioned in Article 1: 255 of the Dutch Civil Code.The juvenile court judge will therefore put [first name minor] under supervision for the duration of six months.
