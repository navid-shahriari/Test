Court of The Hague
STATION SECTION Utrecht Administrative Law Case number: NL22.4778
pronunciation of the single chamber in the case between
[plaintiff], claimant V-number: [V-number]
(authorized representative: A. Hashem Jawaheri),
and
The State Secretary of Justice and Security, Defendant.
Process
Plaintiff lodged an appeal against the defendant's decision on the defendant of 24 February 2022 (the contested decision).
Consideration
1. Because the appeal is apparently inadmissible, the court makes a decision without a hearing.Article 8:54 of the General Administrative Law Act (Awb) makes that possible.The court then explains why the appeal is apparently inadmissible.
2. Someone who loses an appeal must pay court fees.This is stated in Article 8:41 of the Awb.In a case like this, the court fees are â‚¬ 184.The clerk of the court sets a period within which the clerk must be paid.The entire amount must be credited to the court's account within that period or then paid at the court registry.If the court fees are not paid or not in time, the court declares the appeal inadmissible.That is only different if it is not or not to pay the court fee on time.
3. The Registrar has given the claimant sent by registered letter of 23 April 2022 to pay the court fee within four weeks of the date of that letter.Plaintiff did not pay the court fee and has not given any reason for this absenteeism.
4. The appeal is therefore apparently inadmissible.There is no reason for a proceedings order.
Decision
The court declares the appeal inadmissible.
