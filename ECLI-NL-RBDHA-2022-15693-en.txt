Explanation of justice and distribution
Jurisdiction
Now that the Dutch court has jurisdiction with regard to the request for divorce, he also has jurisdiction with regard to the requested with regard to the matrimonial assets of the parties.
Applicable law
The woman states that the parties have entered into marital conditions during the closure of the marriage.In the marriage certificate it is under the heading "
Conditions "
included under a a provision that relates to the settlement of matrimonial assets and that has been signed by both parties.The woman states that the parties have made a choice of law for Iranian law with the entering into these marital conditions under Iranian law.
The marriage certificate of the parties translated into English states - insofar as currently relevant - the following (hereinafter also: the provision under a):
“(...)
Conditions:
A.
By a collateral irrevocable contract, the wife stipulated that if the divorce is not at her request and accordance to the court finding, the request of divorce is not due to violation of conjugal duties by the wife or her ill humor or bad character, the husbandShould be bound to transfer to the wife up to the half of the assets or its equivalent which has been earned the conjugal life with her.
(...) ”Partly in view of the case law, in the opinion of the court, the regulation included in the aforementioned marriage certificate (the provision under a) on the settlement of matrimonial assets should be regarded as marital conditions under Iranian law (Court of The Hague 5 October 2022, ECLI:NL: GHDHA: 2022: 2153; Court The Hague 26 February 2014, ECLI: NL: GHDHA: 2014: 486 and Hof Arnhem-Leeuwarden 2 July 2020, ECLI: NL: Gharl: 2020: 5397).After all, in view of the date of the marriage closure - in 2017 - the court must answer the question of the applicable matrimonial property law on the basis of the Haags Marriages Convention of 14 March 1978, TRB.1988, 130 (hereinafter also HHV).Article 3 of the HHV stipulates that the matrimonial property regime is governed by the internal law that the spouses have designated before marriage.According to Article 11 of the HHV, the designation of the applicable law must have been explicitly agreed or unambiguously resulted from marital conditions.In the opinion of the court, the latter is the case.The marital conditions were drawn up in Iran in front of an Iranian official.Provisions are included in the prenuptial agreement with regard to matrimonial assets.This condition deviates from the Iranian legal system that - in short - a exclusion from each community of goods.The Marriage Agency of the Parties is therefore governed by Iranian law.
In view of the foregoing, the court will allocate the woman's request to issue a statement that applies to the matrimonial property regime of the parties of Iranian law.
Division
In the provision under a, the parties - according to the foregoing, freely translated - have been agreed in short that if the divorce is not at the request of the woman and in accordance with the finding of the court, the request for divorce is not due to violation of marital dutiesBecause of the woman or with her bad mood/temperament or bad character, the man is obliged to transfer half of the possessions or equivalent that he has built up with her to the woman during marriage life.
In a similar case, with (almost) identical marital conditions, the Court of Appeal of The Hague (ECLI: NL: GHDHA: 2021: 168) recently asked the Supreme Court the following preliminary rules.
1) The Dutch public order, as referred to in Article 10: 6 of the Dutch Civil Code, opposes the application of a clause from the - legally valid - marital conditions of the spouses, which stipulates that the woman can only claim theHalf of the man's assets when (i) the divorce has not been requested by her and (ii) the judge did not determine that the divorce is the result of the women's refusal to comply with her marital obligations or of immoral behaviorFrom the woman?
2) In case the answer to the aforementioned question is in the affirmative, what consequences this has for the marriage property regime of the parties: in that case the marital conditions apply with the exception of the offended component (as a result of which the woman is entitled to half of the marital capital ofthe man, regardless of who has requested and regardless of divorce, or regardless of the guilt) or the prenuptial agreement in their entirety (as a result of which the legal system of overall separation revives under Iranian law and the woman is not entitled to the marital assets of the man,Even if the divorce has been requested by the man and the woman is not to blame for the divorce)?
The Supreme Court (ECLI: NL: HR: 2021: 1721) answered these questions as follows.
A provision (agreed legally agreed according to the applicable foreign law) in marital conditions that depends on matrimonial property law depending on the answer to the question of which spouse has requested the divorce and whether the spouse is to blame for the divorce, can apparently be incompatible with public order.After all, such a provision distinguishes between the spouses (in the phase prior to the submission of a divorce request) and can lead to a limitation of the right of access to the court and to an infringement of the right to respect for privacyof the relevant husband.The question of whether that distinction and that limitation or infringement lead to a result that is apparently incompatible with public order, however, cannot be answered in a general sense, now that in that regard there is also meaning to the other facts and circumstances of the specific case,In particular the degree of involvement of the Netherlands in that case.The dismay of provisions in marital conditions, on the ground that they lead to a result that is apparently incompatible with public order, does not in itself do not result in the other other conditions for the rest of their application.This means that the application of public order only affects those parts of the legal act that lead to a result that is apparently incompatible with public order and that only those parts are not applied.The starting point is that the marital conditions - if stripped of such provisions conflicting with public order - are otherwise not obviously incompatible with public order.
The court is considering - in line with the judgments of the Court of The Hague (ECLI: NL: GHDHA: 2022: 1288 and ECLI: NL: GHDHA: 2022: 2153) Following the preliminary questions - as follows.
In the opinion of the court, the involvement of the Netherlands must be tested for the moment when the Dutch court is asked to make a decision about the matrimonial property regime of the parties.After all, there are no (special) legal regulations - as there are, for example, for the recognition of a marriage that has been taken abroad - that explicitly prescribe that the involvement of the Netherlands must be tested for the moment of entering into the marital conditions.Furthermore, the nature of the legal act and the intended legal consequence justify that the involvement of the Netherlands in this case is tested for the moment when the Dutch court is asked to make a decision on this.It concerns marital conditions that amount to the woman only on the condition that the divorce is not desired by her and that she is not to blame for that, can claim the assets of the man he acquired during the marriage of the parties,While the man has no claim whatsoever to (part of) the wife's assets.These marital conditions apply during the marriage of the parties and look at - in this case: the settlement by the Dutch divorce judge of the - assets that the man obtained during the marital period.The marriage of the parties has largely taken place in the Netherlands and during this period the parties have acquired their (possible) assets in the Netherlands.A regulation as described in the prenuptial agreement in which the financial settlement of the divorce is made a distinction who requests the divorce and the question of guilt must be answered and, depending on it, the settlement must be determined, is thereby contrary to public orderdeemed.
The question that subsequently arises is to what extent the woman in this case can derive a matrimonial property claim from the prenuptial agreement minus the parts thereof affected by the public order and not applicable.This should - now that Iranian law applies to matrimonial assets - be assessed according to Iranian matrimonial property law.
In the opinion of the court, the loss of the disputed provision in the present case (also under Iranian law) cannot mean that what remains still (unconditionally) applies.To this end, the court considers as follows.
As follows from the answer to the preliminary questions by the Supreme Court, it has not applied of provisions in marital conditions, on the ground that they lead to a result that is apparently incompatible with public order, in itself not the result that those maritalConditions also remain inapplicable for the rest.The starting point is that the marital conditions - if stripped of such provisions conflicting with public order - are otherwise not obviously incompatible with public order.If in maritalConditions Multiple provisions have been included in which one provision contains parts that result in conflict with public order, this does not automatically mean that all provisions in marital conditions must not be applied.However, the present marital conditions concern only one provision (the provision under a), formulated in one sentence, whereby the woman can, under certain conditions, claim half of the asset of the man accrued during the marriage.The offending parts of the provision relate to all the conditions set out.The conditions and the result are inextricably linked.Now that - due to a violation of Dutch public order - all conditions that the agreed consequence bring with it is not applied, this cannot mean that, according to Iranian law, the provision must be understood in such a way that it has been unconditionally entered into and the manIn the event of divorce, half of his capacity accrued during the wedding must share with the woman.In the opinion of the court, such an explanation may (also) be considered correct under Iranian law.
In addition, the court also considers that it must be considered whether it was the intention of the parties to (also) (also) unconditionally enter into this provision.The court considers it sufficiently established that (in any case) the man (at the time of entering into the provision and now) not unconditionally in the event of divorce wants to (de) reveal to the woman in half of his assets accrued during the marriage.The court considers that the man - to the court understands from his message of 15 November 2022 - has withdrawn his defense and independent requests in that light, so that only the woman still requests a divorce.In addition, it became clear during the session that there is also a higher appeal procedure about the bridal gift.The man states (also) in that procedure that he does not owe the bridal gift under Iranian law to the woman because the woman requests the divorce.In the foregoing, the court considers that the provision under a only entitles the woman to the woman's marriage power, while he does not claim the man's matrimonial assets.It is not reasonable for the man to unconditionally entitle a provision that entails such an inequality.In addition, the court considers that the provision is a deviation on the Iranian legal system that - in short - entails an exclusion from each community of property.The court is of the opinion that it is therefore sufficiently established that the man has never had to see the provision under an unconditional.
In view of the foregoing, the court concludes that the provision under A is completely applicable.As a result, the parties are dependent on the Iranian legal system that - in short - entails an exclusion from each community of property.This means that the court rejects the other requests of the woman with regard to the distribution.
