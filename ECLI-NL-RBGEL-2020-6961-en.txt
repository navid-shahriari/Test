2.6.
With the documents there is email traffic between the respective lawyers of [plaintiff] and [defendant] on the following dates with, insofar as relevant here, the following content:
- on 9 September 2019 of the lawyer of [plaintiff] to the lawyer of [defendant]:
In accordance with the judgment of the Arnhem District Court of 21 August 2019, the Client will provide security in the relevant procedure.Can you make your third -party account number known to me so that the client can transfer the funds to your account?
- on 10 September 2019 of the lawyer of [defendant] to the lawyer of [plaintiff]:
You can have your client deposited the costs on your third -party funds, or have your client do this at a bailiff or notary, and thus send a copy of it to the court.
Otherwise, the process and proof of certainty (or that this took place) would have to keep action on my part, which in my opinion cannot be the intention.
- on September 16, 2019 of the lawyer of [plaintiff] to the lawyer of [defendant]:
For security, the funds have been deposited on the bank account of Flanderijn Bailiffs and are kept there as security.I informed the court about this.
2.7.
The lawyer of [plaintiff] sent a letter to the court on 16 September 2019, with the following content here being relevant here
For the purpose of the judgment of 21 August 2019, on behalf of the client, Mr [plaintiff], as an appendix to this letter, I attach a bank statement that shows that the client has transferred the funds of EUR 2,226.50 (EUR 2,166 plus EUR 60, plus EUR 60,50 -costs bailiff) to the bank account of bailiff Flanderijn.The bailiff will keep these funds in your decision in the main proceedings.I send a copy of this letter by e-mail to mr. T.P.Farmer, authorized representative of [defendant].
The letter has a printout of a letter with a logo from SNS Bank stating that on 15 September 2019 an amount € 2,226.50 was transferred from a bill in the name of [name 5] to a bill in the name of "Flanderijn".
2.8.With the documents there is email traffic between Flanderijn collection bailiffs (further: Flanderijn) and the lawyer of [plaintiff] on the following dates with, insofar as relevant here, the following content:
- On 24 September 2019 from Flanderijn to the lawyer of [plaintiff]:
The funds have been received in good order.
We await your further instructions.
- On October 28, 2019 from Flanderijn to the lawyer of [plaintiff]
In the meantime, can you tell us what to do with the stores in this regard?
- On October 28, 2019 from the lawyer of [plaintiff] to Flanderijn
The judge has not yet made a decision in this matter.As soon as the judge has decided, I will send the verdict to you.If Mr [plaintiff] has been ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings, the funds can be transferred to Mr [defendant].

The dispute
3.1.
[plaintiff] claims in summary - conviction of [defendant] by judgment, enforceable in stock, to pay € 31,892.07, of which € 5,000 in extrajudicial costs, plus interest and procedural costs.
3.2.
[plaintiff] states that an agreement was concluded between him and [defendant] on the basis of which [defendant] would ensure that [plaintiff] could emigrate illegally with his family to the United Kingdom at least Western Europe.
[plaintiff] states that he has paid [defendant] the following amounts on the basis of that agreement:
€ 1,500.00 in Iran, deposit to the travel agency
€ 5,000.00 in Iran, on account of [name 3]
€ 4,992.00 in Turkey, via Western Union to [defendant]
€ 3,000.00 in Belgrade, cash to [defendant]
€ 8,400.00 in Greece, cash to [defendant] via a border exchange office.
This is helpful by [defendant] in providing [plaintiff] and his family of access and/or transit by one or more Member States of the European Union, while [defendant] knew or should have suspected that this was unlawful, can be qualifiedAs human smuggling and contrary to the law and punishable.All the more so now that according to [plaintiff] it happened from the profit of profit and, according to him, it seems that [defendant] makes his profession or habit of it.The same applies to making false residual documents available by [defendant].These criminal offenses thus made [plaintiff] an essential part of the agreement, with which that agreement contrary to the law, public order and/or good morals and therefore void.According to [plaintiff], the agreement was also concluded under the influence of abuse of circumstances, now that [plaintiff] was moved to pay the amounts in the expectation that [defendant] and his family a better future in WestEurope could offer.[plaintiff] in the alternative, the destruction of the agreement is requested.The payments of a total of € 22,892.07 have in any case been paid unduly and therefore, according to [plaintiff], must be repaid.In the alternative, [plaintiff] states that [defendant] has failed to fulfill his obligations under the agreement, since emigration has not been successful.[defendant] must also repay the amount of € 22,892.07 on that ground, as compensation.The actions of [defendant] can also be regarded as an unlawful act, according to [plaintiff], as a result of which [plaintiff] has suffered damage, consisting of, in addition to the aforementioned amount of € 22,892.07, an amount of € 4,000.00in costs of tickets, hotels and necessities.[plaintiff] claims compensation for that damage.
3.3.
[defendant] defends.
3.4.
The statements of the parties are discussed below, insofar as relevant.
4. The assessment
jurisdiction
4.1.
In this case with international aspects, the Dutch court is authorized now that [defendant] has residence in the Netherlands (Article 4 paragraph 1 renewed EEX Regulation No 1215/2012).
susceptibility
4.2.
[defendant] primarily demands that [plaintiff] will be declared inadmissible in his claim.This is because, according to [defendant], [plaintiff] has not, or not in time, fulfilled security in the way stipulated in Article 6:51 of the Dutch Civil Code, for the costs of [defendant] to be on the part of € 2,166, 00, to which he was convicted in the interlocutory judgment of 21 August 2019.
4.3.That is not disputed, as also from the in r.o.2.6 Conducted email exchange follows, the lawyer of [plaintiff] has offered to deposit the amount of € 2,166.00 into the third -party account of the lawyer of [defendant].In the opinion of the court, there would be a certainty that is such that the costs of the proceedings, if [plaintiff] is convicted of this, are covered with this and that [defendant] will then be able to reconcile a story without much effort.On behalf of [defendant] this proposal was rejected and the proposal was made that the amount is deposited under a bailiff, which then also happened.[defendant] has the content of the in r.o.2.7.Cited letter from the lawyer of [plaintiff] to the court and the enclosed printout of SNS not substantiated, nor the content of the in r.o.2.8.cited email exchange with Flanderijn.It follows that the amount of € 2,166.00 on 15 September 2019 was transferred to a bill from Flanderijn, that Flanderijn received this amount and that it has been ordered to transfer the amount to [defendant] after receiving a judgment withA proceedings order from [plaintiff].Now that [defendant] has rejected the certainty on the third -party money account of her lawyer and has made the proposal to deposit the money into the account of a bailiff, it can possibly still be unclear about the precise conditions under which [defendant] on the deposited thereCan not take money story to [plaintiff].In any case, it is not substantiated that story will not (without difficulty) be possible.In these circumstances, the court is of the opinion that the security has been sufficiently met in the manner specified in Article 6:51, to which [plaintiff] was ordered in the interlocutory judgment.This is, unlike [defendant], also happened in time, before 18 September 2019. There is therefore no question of inadmissibility.
Agreement [plaintiff] and [defendant]
4.4.
There is no point of dispute that an agreement was concluded between [plaintiff] and [defendant].[plaintiff] states that [defendant] has committed himself to a total of € 22,892.07 to ensure that [plaintiff] could emigrate to England or Germany with his family and that he would give them access to West-Europe.The fact that he would "take care of that" is disputed by [defendant], but he does not dispute that it was agreed for a fee that he would do his best, to be helpful and provide his services for this.It is therefore established that it has been agreed that [defendant] would provide services that at least contribute to the wishes of [plaintiff] to travel and / or emigrate with his family to Western Europe.[plaintiff] primarily states that the agreement between the parties was void.
applicable law.
4.5.
The question of whether there was a void agreement will be assessed under Dutch law, since this is the law that controls the agreement.After all, insofar as the parties have not already intended to make a choice of law for Dutch law, [defendant] has, as a service provider, at least characteristic prestant, its habitual residence in the Netherlands (Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and theCouncil of 17 June 2008 on the law that applies to commitments from Agreement (Rome I) Article 4).It is not (explicitly) stated that [defendant] acted in the conduct of his business or profession within the meaning of Article 6 of Rome I
The content of the agreement is contrary to good morals, public order and / or compelling legal provision.
4.6.
It is established that the agreement meant that [defendant] would be helpful [plaintiff] when emigrating from Iran to Western Europe.It was not disputed that the plan was that [plaintiff] and his family for that purpose would be illegally given access to Western Europe because they could not get a visa.It is not contradicted that the agreement would also mean [defendant] to contribute to this.[defendant] did not dispute that he knew that it would be used for false and forged identity papers and that this actually happened, albeit without success.His statement that he himself has not been involved in making and to [plaintiff] and his family of those papers is rejected as insufficiently substantiated.After all, from the content of the contents of the in r.o.2.4.Communication shown per WhatsApp and of the in r.o.2.5.Reported report of the conversation between [defendant] and (supporters of) [plaintiff] follows that [defendant], at least twice, has complied with '[name 2]' with the aim of it for [plaintiff] and his family, at least twice, would make 'better' forged travel documents.The court then considers a bald denial of his involvement.
4.7.The content of an agreement with the aim of contributing to illegal access to the European Union with the use of false documents is contrary to mandatory legal provisions (Article 197a and 231 of the Criminal Code) and public order, as onNone of the parties is disputed.Insofar as [defendant] states that there is no question of illegality and of violation of law or public order, because [plaintiff] and his family were in an emergency situation, this statement is also rejected as insufficiently motivated.[plaintiff] himself disputed that there was an emergency situation and states that he was only in a situation, just like everyone in Iran who is Sunni or Kurd, that he wanted to go to Europe because of oppression and the lack of opportunities on the labor market.What the emergency situation would exist in this specific case did not substantiate [defendant].
void agreement
4.8.
The conclusion is that the agreement is void.This means that the legal basis for payments that [plaintiff] has made to [defendant] under that void agreement is lacking and that [plaintiff] can reclaim this from [defendant] as unduly.
the amount of the amount paid unduly
4.9.
The parties argue about what [plaintiff] has paid to [defendant] under the void agreement and what must therefore be paid as unduly paid.[defendant] disputed with reasons that he himself received more than € 3,000.00, via Western Union, from [plaintiff].He also disputes that the payments of € 1,500.00 mentioned by [plaintiff] in Iran, "deposit to the travel agency", and of € 5,000.00 in Iran, on account of [name 3], were made to him.
4.10.
With regard to the payment of € 3,000.00, [defendant] states that he has reimbursed this amount, when the plan to travel to Western Europe, repaid and even more than that, namely € 4,000.00, in payments of 1times € 2,000.00 and 2 times € 1,000.00, always via Western Union.The fact that [plaintiff] received € 4,000.00 from [defendant] is not disputed by [plaintiff].His statement that this was separate from the agreement, that this cannot be seen as a repayment and that this has been paid as a donation, is rejected as insufficiently substantiated.This is also in contradiction with the ruling of [plaintiff] himself during the oral hearing, that he received the payment of € 2,000.00 from [defendant] to be able to purchase a false passport.Furthermore, it is not disputed that this amount was paid in the same period that [plaintiff] and his family tried to travel to Western Europe, and that this payment was made (also to cover costs of accommodation costs during the trip.The mere circumstance that [defendant] states that he has paid this out of helpfulness does not mean that it is a donation and that this does not arise from the same, void agreement, which [defendant] would, in his own words, would also have entered into helpfulness.
4.11.
It is therefore now currently involved in determining whether more has been paid to [defendant] under the agreement than the amount of € 4,000.00 paid by [defendant].[Defendant] has recognized the payment of € 3,000.00.The burden of proof of larger payments lies on the basis of the main rule of Article 150 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure with [plaintiff], who, after all, links the right to this that [defendant] must repay that several as unduly paid.
The court considers that it has not been submitted to means of evidence so far in not being sufficient to come to the conclusion that these larger payments have been proven, all the more so now that the proofs of payment submitted are untrained and cannot simply be drawn up or this for payments to [defendant] go.Furthermore, the in r.o.2.6.Cited WhatsApp messages from 31 October 2018 from 5:34 am a indication that [plaintiff] made a payment to [defendant] through the account of [name 3], and that he would have 'caught' 50% of them,But on the basis of those few messages it cannot yet be proven that € 5,000.00 was paid to [defendant] via this [name 3] in Iran.[plaintiff] will be admitted to further proof of proof of these stipulated larger payments.
4.12.
Now that the agreement is void, there is no longer any room for the annulment of this agreement due to the abuse of circumstances, nor is there an attributable shortcoming of [defendant] in his obligations under that Agreement.These (subsidiary) propositions of [plaintiff] about this can remain undiscussed.
unlawful action
4.13.[plaintiff] also claims a reimbursement of € 4,000.00 for damage he claims to have suffered as a result of unlawful acts of [defendant].However, the statement that [defendant] acted unlawfully towards [plaintiff] is rejected as insufficiently substantiated.The circumstance that the agreement has a content that conflicts with the law and public order does not mean that it is also aware of the unlawful nature of the content of the agreement by [defendant] to that agreement against [plaintiff], which is also against [plaintiff]Was and apparently cooperated, was unlawful.The court also considers that [defendant] has abused the circumstances of [plaintiff] insufficiently concrete, all the more now that [plaintiff] himself declares that there was no emergency situation.That there was a suppression of the population group to which [plaintiff] belongs and, because of the ethnic origin and faith of [plaintiff] and his family, a factual lack of possibilities on finding a job and a reasonable future, such as[plaintiff] does not automatically state that entering into an agreement to bring [plaintiff] illegally to Western Europe to abuse that situation or was otherwise unlawful towards [plaintiff].Insofar as [plaintiff] states that [defendant] has instructed [plaintiff] against better judgment in a possibility of traveling illegally to Western Europe, while this was actually impossible, he did not substantiate this statement.The claim of [plaintiff] cannot therefore be granted, insofar as based on this set unlawful act.
4.14.
