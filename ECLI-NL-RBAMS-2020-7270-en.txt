The oral treatment took place on November 18, 2020.

Grounds of the decision
Facts
1. If stated and not (sufficiently) contradicted, the following is certain:
1.1.
Together with [name], [plaintiff] lived in the house at the [address], hereinafter: the house.[name] has been renting this home from Vesteda since January 2016. The lease is exclusively to its name.
1.2.
[plaintiff] and [name] have been married earlier.They were divorced in 2009.They have lived together again from 2012 to August 2019, most recently from 2016 in the home of Vesteda.They have four children who were born in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2019.
1.3.
By e-mail of 3 July 2019, Vesteda announced [plaintiff] that, with reference to the payment behavior of [name], it is not eligible for co-tenancy within the meaning of Article 7: 267 of the Dutch Civil Code.As soon as the payments run well again, it can submit a request again, says Vesteda.
1.4.
In connection with mutual problems, [plaintiff], together with her children, has left the home on a summation of [name] at the end of August 2019.[name] then changed the locks.[plaintiff] has since been living with her mother in a senior flat in [place].
1.5.
[name] refuses to cooperate in making a joint request for co -tenancy.[plaintiff] has filed for summary proceedings against [name] and claimed the issue of items and, in addition, to make a request to Vesteda to co -tenancy.By judgment of 10 March 2020, the subdistrict court judge granted both claims.[name] was convicted of cooperating in obtaining co -tenancy within the meaning of Article 7: 267 of the Dutch Civil Code for [plaintiff] with regard to the home with the lessor Vesteda, in the absence of which the judgment had to be the cooperation of [name]designated.An appeal has been made against the judgment, in which appeal has not yet been decided.The oral treatment will take place in December 2020.
1.6.
Shortly afterwards, Vesteda rejected the request for co -tenancy because [plaintiff] did not meet a number of conditions as referred to in Article 7: 267 of the Dutch Civil Code.For example, [plaintiff] would no longer have the main residence in the home and she did not meet the condition of a sustainable common household.Finally, Vesteda did not consider that [plaintiff] offered sufficient financial guarantees.
Progress
2. [plaintiff] claims that it will be determined in the case of enforceable judgment that [plaintiff] will be at least with effect from the date of this judgment with effect from a date to be determined by the subdistrict court judge, co -tenant of the property, with conviction, with convictionVan Vesteda in the costs of the proceedings, plus the statutory interest on this from the fourteenth day after the date of the judgment.3. According to [plaintiff], it meets all conditions set by Article 7: 267 of the Dutch Civil Code.When entering into the lease with Vesteda in 2016, she was forced to stay in the hospital for some time and that is the only reason why she did not end up on the lease agreement as a (second) tenant at the time.She is now forced to stay outside the home in question, but this does not mean that she has given up her main residence.There is also a sustainable common household.In the past, just like when she lived with [name] at a different address, [plaintiff] contributed to the costs of the household and also paid the rent more often.She has submitted supporting documents.She also has financial reserves, given her assets in Morocco, among other things.Finally, she points out that she is in an emergency situation.She lives with her mother.The senior apartment is absolutely not suitable for living there with two adults and four children, while this situation has been around since August 2019.
4. Vesteda defends.She considers [plaintiff] inadmissible in her request, since this request has not also been submitted on behalf of [name].She points out that Article 7: 267 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code stipulates that such a request must be made to the court jointly with the (main) tenant.Vesteda also points out that the conditions for co -tenancy are not met and that the request is therefore not eligible for granting on substantive grounds.
Judgement
5. As already discussed at the hearing, there is no doubt that [plaintiff] is in an extremely difficult situation.[name] does not want her to return to the home.Much longer stay in her mother's home, together with her four children, is also not good.[plaintiff] explained at the hearing that the situation has a very negative effect on her children and that some children show worrying behavioral problems.It is therefore clear that [plaintiff] has a great interest in obtaining other living space.But the question is whether the road chosen for this, namely making a request to grant co -tenancy of the home, in view of the legal obstacles as submitted by Vesteda, is the right way for this.
6. According to Article 7: 267 of the Dutch Civil Code, a request to the lessor as co -tenancy and, after rejection thereof by the landlord, the request for the court, must be requested,
joint
(Cursing Subdistrict Court) to be done.[Plaintiff] does not meet that condition.In the summons, only she is mentioned as plaintiff.According to the - not yet irrevocable - judgment in summary proceedings of 10 March 2020, [name] has been ordered to cooperate in obtaining co -tenancy of the home near Vesteda.[name] did not provide that cooperation.The judgment in question does not stipulate that [name] must also cooperate by making a joint request to the court after a possible rejecting decision by Vesteda.[name] is not involved in the present procedure.The foregoing seems to have to lead to the conclusion that [plaintiff] does not meet the condition of making a joint request to the court within the meaning of Article 7: 267 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code.The subdistrict court judge, however, considered it designated to await the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the appeal procedure, now that there may be further clarity about the legal position of [plaintiff] on this point.
7. The following also argues for the arrest of this case pending the judgment of the Court of Appeal.In the judgment of 10 March 2020, the judge in summary proceedings based its decision in particular on the idea that under certain circumstances it can be expected that the (main) tenant will also cooperate in a joint request when the main tenant and intended co-tenant are separated, because otherwise theProtection of the cohabitant towards the landlord is blocked (see, among others, HR 10 October 1980 NJ 1981/132).8. [name] and [plaintiff] had a sustainable joint household in the period from 2012 to the end of August 2019.This came to an end at the end of August 2019.In itself, the court can also assign a request for co -tenancy after the termination of the common household.The condition for this applies that this request has been made as soon as possible after that termination if it can reasonably be required in the given circumstances (HR August 14, 2015, ECLI: NL: HR: 2015: 2193).In the situation that was discussed in the judgment of the HR, the cohabitation was already definitively broken for five months at the time of the submission of the request, and that, partly in view of additional circumstances, was considered too long.The judge in summary in the case between [plaintiff] and [name] considered that [plaintiff] has paid the aforementioned condition (that the request has been made as soon as possible after the termination if it can reasonably be expected in the given circumstances) and that issue lies inAppeal again for assessment.For that reason, too, the subdistrict court judge considers it to keep the decision in the present case pending the outcome of the apple procedure.
9. It is not yet known when a decision of the Court of Appeal in the case [plaintiff] / [name] can be expected, the case will be arrested by a large term until 16 February 2021 for deed statement on the part of [plaintiff]With regard to the outcome of the procedure at the Court of Appeal.If clarity is obtained faster, it is of course free to request the subdistrict court judge to put the case on the role earlier.
10. The foregoing of course does not alter, as discussed at the hearing, that [plaintiff] is doing well, given the uncertainties with regard to the outcome of this procedure, not only for the anchor of this procedure, but also forTo be seen for alternatives.Vesteda indicated at the hearing to see a possible request from [plaintiff] to jointly look for suitable housing elsewhere in its file.
