Grounds of the decision
Assumptions
1. The following is assumed.
1.1.
[defendant], born on [date of birth] 1978, has been employed by A.S since December 4, 2007.Watson and is most recently working in the position of hostess.The gross salary is € 1,197.04 per month excluding holiday allowance.
1.2.
[defendant] reported sick on 11 May 2018.She was pregnant at that time, but her maternity leave had not yet taken effect.
1.3.
After her maternity leave, the company doctor determined in a report of 23 October 2018 that [defendant] had marginal opportunities for work resumption.She then went to work in suitable work for 3 x 1 hour a week.
1.4.
In a report of 13 November 2018, the company doctor advised to expand this schedule by December 2018 by 3 x 30 - 60 minutes.
1.5.
Halfway through January 2019, [defendant] stopped working in the context of her reintegration and not published at the consultation hour of the company doctor of 17 January 2019. A.S.Watson [defendant] given a warning by letter of 18 January 2019.A.S.Watson informed [defendant] that the costs of the vain consultation will be charged to [defendant] and settled with her wages.Against this, [defendant] protested by letter of 25 January 2019.ASH.Watson rejected that protest by e-mail of 30 January 2019.
1.6.
In a report of 29 January 2019, the company doctor advised to use [defendant] for 3 x 2 hours a week in adjusted work.Furthermore, the company doctor advises parties to talk to each other regarding the disturbed relationship of trust.
1.7.
On 7 February 2019, a conversation took place between [defendant] on the one hand and [name 3] and [name 2] on behalf of A.S.Watson on the other.During that interview, [defendant] announced, among other things, that he does not agree with the advice of the company doctor with regard to her taxability.[name 3] and/or [name 2] then pointed her to the possibility of asking an expert opinion at the UWV.
1.8.
By letter of 8 February 2019, A.S.Watson confirmed the aforementioned interview and [defendant], among other things, requested a confirmation of receipt of the expert report to A.S.Watson to send.Furthermore, she has stated that she would start from the advice of the company doctor and therefore expected that [defendant] will start reintegration activities by 16 February 2019 by 16 February 2019.ASH.Watson puts the wage in the prospect in the event of [defendant] does not comply with this.[defendant] has not responded to this call.
1.9.By letter of 21 February 2019, A.S.Watson written to [defendant] that it has been found that she did not submit a request to the UWV so that A.S.Watson will stop payment of sickness benefit from 16 February 2019.This cancellation has a.s.Watson canceled retroactively after it appeared that [defendant] (still) had submitted an application for an expert report to the UWV.
1.10.
On 4 April 2019, the UWV issued the expert opinion requested by [defendant].The UWV insurance doctor has determined that the advice of the company doctor of January 29, 2019 is appropriate.The labor expert comes to the conclusion that the reintegration efforts carried out by [defendant] have been insufficient.
1.11.
On Thursday, April 18, another conversation took place between [defendant], [name 3] and [name 2].By letter of 19 April 2019, A.S.Watson confirmed this conversation to [defendant].Furthermore, A.S.Watson written in the letter that [defendant] is not sufficiently cooperating with her reintegration and that she therefore stops payment of sickness benefit until the moment [defendant] starts with reintegration.She also tells [defendant] that her lack of cooperation can have consequences for her employment.ASH.Watson calls on [defendant] to start her reintegration.ASH.Watson then stopped paying sickness benefit as of 4 April 2019.
1.12.
On 31 May 2019, [defendant] visited the consultation hour of the company doctor.The report drawn up as a result of this shows that the company doctor remains in his view that [defendant] has useful possibilities.The company doctor also writes that he explained [defendant] during the consultation hour that if she does not agree with his vision, she can ask a second opinion from another company doctor, but that [defendant] did not want to make use of this.
1.13.
By letter of 17 June 2019, [name 1] on behalf of A.S.Watson [defendant] called to contact [name 2] no later than 20 June 2019 to make an appointment to perform suitable work, failing which [name 1] on behalf of A.S.Watson will submit a request for termination of the employment contract to the subdistrict court judge.
1.14.
From the moment her maternity leave entered, [defendant] received a WAZO benefit from the UWV.At the end of the pregnancy leave, this benefit was converted into benefits on the basis of the Sickness Benefits Act, since it turned out to be incapacitated for work as a direct result of her pregnancy.On 3 June 2019, [defendant] visited the consultation hour of [name 4], insurance doctor at the UWV.In a report drawn up as a result of this, [name 4] concluded that there is no longer any question of incapacity for work as of 3 June 2019 as a direct consequence of pregnancy and/or delivery within the meaning of the Sickness Benefits Act.The benefit was then stopped by the UWV as of that date.
1.15.
The benefits granted to [defendant] of the UWV are always on the UWV to A.S.Watson transferred.Until April 4 (see under 1.11) a.s.Watson continued the benefit to [defendant].
Request and defense
2. A.S.Watson requests the employment contract with the [defendant] to terminate on the basis of Article 7: 671b paragraph 1, part a jo.7: 669 paragraph 3, part e and g of the Civil Code (BW).
3. A.S.Watson is based on-in short-seriously culpable acts of [defendant], since she has stubbornly refused to cooperate in reintegration for no sound reason.She therefore has a.s.Watson was not given the opportunity to properly reintegrate it and therefore not adhered to the rules with regard to illness and reintegration.Under those circumstances, relocation in another function is not an option.Because of her persistent refusal, a disturbed employment relationship has also arisen.Because her actions are seriously culpable, [defendant] is not entitled to a transition payment and the legal notice period does not have to be taken into account when dissolving, according to A.S.Watson.4. [defendant] defends himself against the request.To this end, it leads the following - in summary.[defendant] does experience complaints that make it impossible to reintegrate now.This concerns psychological complaints that are separate from her pregnancy, as is also apparent from the report by insurance doctor [name 4].In the meantime, [name 5] of the Bigmove Institute has established that there is a serious depressive disorder another specified anxiety disorder.[defendant] started a specialist mental health treatment and this seems to have a positive effect.It has not been sufficiently documented how the applicant has made an effort to help the defendant with her reintegration.In view of the size of the organization, another function could have been offered.[defendant] still feels sick, so that the employment contract may not be terminated.There were good medical reasons for not cooperating in reintegration.If the employment contract is terminated, [defendant] is entitled to a transition payment of € 5,729.00.In addition, she is entitled to a fair reimbursement of at least € 25,000.00, now a.s.Watson has controlled a dissolution and a disturbed employment relationship without a valid reason.Furthermore, [defendant] claims for the aforementioned reasons for the removal of the pay stop and payment of the wage due, according to [defendant].
Judgement
5. It follows from Article 7: 671b paragraph 1 in conjunction with 7: 669 paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code that the employment contract can only be dissolved if there is a reasonable ground for this as referred to in Article 7: 669 paragraph 3 under c to h of the Dutch Civil Code and Relocation ofThe employee is not possible within a reasonable period of time or is not reasonable.
6. In the opinion of the subdistrict court judge, the A.S.Watson put forward facts and circumstances a reasonable ground for dissolution.To this end, it is considered that both the company doctor and the then consulted expert at the UWV have ruled that [defendant] must be able to come and work on a labor therapeutic basis 3 x 2 hours a week.A.S.Watson go out, all the more so since [defendant] has always stated that it has only stated that she was unable to meet these advice.However, [defendant] has submitted a document in her defense that it could show that on 3 July 2019 she was entering into a treatment agreement for fifteen group discussions with a recognized mental health care institution, because of depressive complaints and anxiety complaints.Apart from the fact that this treatment agreement has not been signed, this is not sufficient to demonstrate that [defendant] could not meet the advice of the company doctor up to 3 x 2 hours a week from appropriate activities.The fact that the company doctor and insurance doctor would not have taken into account in their judiciary in their judgment of psychological complaints, as suggested by [defendant] in her defense, is also not apparent from their reports.
7. In view of the above, it must be assumed that [defendant] has refused reintegration work without good land.The request for termination of the employment contract can be granted on that ground.Now that the land is located in violation of reintegration obligations, the prohibition of cancellation is not in the way of granting the request for termination due to illness.
8. Although [defendant] can be blamed by its unjustified refusal to perform adapted work, it is considered that, partly in view of plausible personal circumstances, this is not so serious that it would no longer be entitled to a transition payment.This is therefore awarded.Now that the height set by [defendant] of € 5,729.00 of the transition payment not by a.s.Watson is disputed, this amount is allocated.
9. The advanced fair compensation is not assignable, since it is not to a.s.Watson is due to the termination of the employment contract.
10. The consideration under 8 also means that the notice period applicable to [defendant] will be taken into account when determining the termination date.11. Due to the repeated refusal of [defendant] to take up the reintegration, a.s.Watson entitled to set up a wage stop.This means that the claim of [defendant] for cancellation thereof is not assignable.However, the wage stop has discussed a time when there is no wage payment obligation on the side of A.S.Watson existed, since at that time [defendant] was entitled to a benefit from the UWV on the basis of the Sickness Benefits Act up to the amount of its wages.This benefit is up to 3 June 2019 to A.S.Watson paid.ASH.Watson has no longer paid the benefit to [defendant] with an appeal to the loop stop set up from 4 April 2019.In view of this, the claim of [defendant] for payment of overdue wage for the period in question is read as a claim for payment of by A.S.Watson withheld benefit from the UWV.
12. A.S.Watson has argued by deed that, due to the wage stop, she has rightly stopped paying the sickness benefit.After all, on the basis of Article 30 (1) () Sickness Benefits Act, the employee must perform appropriate work and if the employee does not cooperate in reintegration, the UWV has the option to revise or withdraw the benefit, in which case theobligation to reject wage payment.Pursuant to Article 33 (2) Sickness Benefits Act, recovery takes place at the employer.Now that the expectation is real that the UWV will revise the benefit, it will therefore be the claim on a.s.Watson stories, according to A.S.Watson.In the alternative, a.s.Watson argued that she was allowed to suspend payment of sickness benefit because in the other case the wage stop it introduced no incentive for [defendant] to tackle reintegration, while that is the purpose of a wage stop.
13. It is undisputed that A.S.In the period 4 April to the beginning of June 2019, Watson received sickness benefit from the UWV granted by the UWV to [defendant].That benefit, which does not fall under a wage stop, served A.S.Watson to [defendant] by paying.ASH.Watson was not entitled to stop paying the sickness benefit at [defendant] at that time in connection with its expectations with regard to a revision of the benefit.Moreover, it is unclear what she bases on those expectations, now that she has not stated that she had made a report with regard to the lack of reintegration efforts at the UWV, at least not stated that the UWV has processed such a report.
14. Also the fact that Van a Pay Stop is no longer an incentive for a.s. in a situation such as the present one.Watson is not a valid reason to withhold the benefit due to [defendant].That the law has not arranged any exception for these types of cases, such as a.s.Watson argues, does not give her the right to think of that exception herself.Moreover, this reason for not continuing the benefit has now been canceled.
15. That means that the wage claim from [defendant] is granted in the sense that A.S.Watson is ordered to pay the sickness benefit from 4 April to 3 June 2019. Since a.s.Watson was entitled to set the pop stop, the wage claim is not allocable for the rest.
16. The costs of the proceedings are compensated in the sense that each party bears its own costs.
