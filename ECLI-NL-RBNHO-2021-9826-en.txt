Parties will be called "the woman" and "the man" below.
The case in short
The woman and the man have been married to Iranian nationality and have been married.Before the parties got married, they concluded a marriage certificate based on Iranian law.This marriage certificate states that the man, if the woman asks, has to give 150 Iranian gold coins.The deed also states that if the man is wealthy, he still has to give 200 extra Iranian gold coins to the woman.The woman claims in this procedure that the man gives her 350 Iranian gold coins to her.The court decides that the man must give 110 Iranian gold coins to the woman, or an amount in euros that is equal to the value of these coins.For 40 Iranian gold coins, the court establishes a payment arrangement.The court rejects the claim for the remaining 200 Iranian gold coins.The woman has not created anything that shows that the man is wealthy.

Facts
2.1.
Parties are married to each other on [wedding date] in Iran.By decision of March 2017 of the Rotterdam District Court, the divorce between the parties was pronounced.
2.2.
Parties both have Iranian nationality.
2.3.
The parties have concluded a marriage certificate prior to the closure of the marriage.In this marriage certificate, the parties agreed a bridal gift that the man, if she asks for it, should give a number of Bahar-e-Azadi gold coins (hereinafter Gold Coins).

The dispute
3.1.
The woman is progressing - in summary and after a change in demand - that the man is convicted:
-
primarily to give 350 gold coins to her or an amount of € 295,522.50 that is equal to the value in euros of 350 gold coins,
-
in the alternative, if in the opinion of the court the man is insufficiently wealthy, to give 150 gold coins to her or an amount of € 126,652.50 that is equal to the value in euros of 150 gold coins and 200 gold coins to herin a period of at least one gold currency per year or an amount of € 168,870, which is equal to the value in euros of 200 gold coins, and
-
(both primary and in the alternative) in the procedural and follow-up costs, plus the statutory interest.
3.2.
To substantiate her claim, the woman argues that the man is obliged to give her 350 gold coins to her on the basis of the bridal gift.The woman disputes that the man has insufficient capacity or ability to give the bridal gift to her.The woman disputes that her claim can be moderated.
3.3.The man defends.The man disputes that he has capacity and ability to do the bridal gift.The woman has no interest in her claim because she receives social assistance benefits.What the man's wife gets will be deducted from her benefit.The woman's claim is too indefinite because it is not clear which coins are involved and what the value of the coins is.The man states that a ruling from a Dutch judge on the bridal gift in Iran is not recognized so that there is a chance that he will be obliged twice to pay the bridal gift to the woman.The man points to case law and the outdated report of the International Legal Institute (hereinafter: IJI), which was submitted by the woman.This case law and the report show that if the claim relates to a bridal gift, more than 110 gold coins, the superior of 110 gold coins can be litigated.The man is of the opinion that the bridal gift must be corrected to reasonableness because the agreed bridal gift is disproportionate.
3.4.
The statements of the parties are discussed below, insofar as relevant.
4
The assessment
4.1.
Parties both live in the Netherlands.Pursuant to this place of residence and Article 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Dutch court is authorized to judge the claim.The matrimonial property regime of the parties is governed by Iranian law on the basis of Article 4, paragraph 3 of the Haags Marriage Conversion of 1978 because the parties both have Iranian nationality.
4.2.
This case is about whether the man should fulfill the agreements made in the marriage certificate about making a wedding gift.The marriage certificate was included under the heading bridal gift “
(...) Fifty -three Bahar Azadi Gold coins, of which fifty -hundred pieces on request and the residual two hundred, if wealthy must provide the wife
".
4.3.
During the oral hearing of the case it became clear that the gold coins in the marriage certificate are described as "full" coins.The court concludes from this that it is the mint with size "1", a "coin weight" of 8,13598 grams, a "pure gold weight" of 7,32238 and a diameter of 22 mm, as described in the piece that the man asProduction 2 has submitted an answer to his conclusion.
4.4.
From the marriage certificate, the court further concludes that the woman can claim 150 gold coins unconditionally and that she can only claim the remaining 200 gold coins in the event that the man is wealthy.For the due payability of those 200 gold coins, the woman must set and, if necessary, prove that the man is wealthy.However, she did not give any starting point for this.The mere proposition that the man lives in the Netherlands and is therefore wealthy by Iranian standards does not cut wood.After all, the man lives in the Netherlands and with his high income for Iranian standards, there are high costs for Iranian standards.The condition for claiming 200 gold coins is not met.This part of the claim is rejected.
4.5.
According to the marriage certificate, the woman can claim issue of 150 gold coins.The man states that this claim must be rejected due to his lack of capacity.
4.6.
To substantiate their views, the parties both referred to the IJI report that was submitted to the summons as production 5.The court will start from Iranian law as described in that IJI report.Because the report was drawn up in 2019, and is therefore fairly recent, there is no reason to request a new IJI report, as the man wants.
4.7.
Under Iranian law, the woman has “
Right to a bridal gift of 110 gold pieces but must be litigated over higher amounts (...).If the man is unable to pay the amount, a repayment scheme can be provided on the basis of payment terms.
"This is because the Iranian legislator intended
“To achieve a balance between the financial interests of women in the context of guaranteeing sufficient financial security after dissolution of the marriage, while the man's capacity must be taken into account that if the amount of the bridal gift seems higher than it seems higher than110 (...) Gold pieces, a legal procedure is mandatory and that a different decision can be made about the surplus (above 110 Bahar Azadi gold pieces), taking into account the capacity and the ability of the man.
"
4.8.
In other words.The man must give 110 gold coins to the woman apart from his capacity and power.It is incorrect that the woman would not have an interest in that because she has social assistance benefits.If only because the payment of those gold coins would lead to no more benefit, with all associated obligations.He has insufficiently substantiated that the man runs the risk that he will be sentenced again in the Gold Coins.Perhaps this verdict in Iran is not recognized and that the woman also wants to get a title in Iran for the release of the gold coins, but it does not follow that the man will have to pay the gold coins twice.
Because Iranian law claims the claim of women, there is no room for a correction to reasonableness and fairness on the basis of Dutch law.
4.9.
The financial interest of the woman with immediate issue of the remaining (150 -/ - 110 =) 40 gold coins considered the man's capacity, the man who has to pay for the remaining 40 gold coins based on an repayment scheme.The two elements considered the court to find a repayment scheme of one gold coin per year reasonable, starting in 2022.
4.10.
The woman demands the man to transfer the gold coins or the value of these coins in euros.The court will assume a value of € 414.10 per gold coin.The court bases that value on the documents submitted by the man in production 2. That one gold coin would be worth € 844.35, as the woman states, she has insufficiently substantiated.The reference to the official exchange rate used by the Iranian Central Bank says nothing about the (free) exchange rate used in the Netherlands.Never, the value that the Iranian association for goldsmiths says something about the value of a gold coin in the Netherlands.
The value of 110 gold coins comes to an amount of (110 x € 414.10 =) € 45,551.
4.11.
For the issue of the 110 gold coins, the court will give the man a period of thirty days after service of this judgment.There is no reason to give the man a longer term.After all, the woman's claim is immediately due and payable.The period that the man receives is (a little) longer than the woman wants.However, the man must be given the opportunity to buy the gold coins.
4.12.
The court is of the opinion that the costs of proceedings between the parties must be compensated because the parties are former spouses.
