The facts
2.1.
The parties are married in Iran on [Date01].The man already lived in the Netherlands then.The woman still lived in Iran.The woman came to the Netherlands in 2018.
2.2.
At the time of the marriage, both had the Iranian nationality and the man also had Dutch nationality.This is also the case now.
2.3.
After the arrival to the Netherlands of the woman, the parties lived together for a few months.Then the cohabitation was broken by the woman.
2.4.
On May 23, 2019, the man submitted a request for divorce to this court.On 10 June 2019, the woman acted a defense and as an independent request asked the court to express the divorce, as well as to order the man to pay € 146,490 in respect of the bridal gift and to the issue of half of his assetsTo the woman.Afterwards the parties withdrew these requests and the procedure ended.
2.5.
On 16 June 2019, the family court of the AHWAZ district in Iran sentenced the man at the request of the woman to pay for a bridal gift of 514 full Bahar Azadi coins.The judgment (hereinafter: the Iranian verdict) states that it was mentioned in absentia.
2.6.
On July 21, 2020, the woman summoned the man in proceedings at this court in which she claims that the man is being ordered to transfer 514 Bahar-E-Azadi Golden Coins or an equivalent thereof equal to € 433,995.90.With a judgment of the Court of Appeal in The Hague in a jurisdiction incident, that procedure was referred back to this court and continued under roll number HA SA 22-810.
2.7.
On October 4, 2022, the woman summoned the man in proceedings at this court in which she claims that the man is being sentenced to cooperate with an Iranian religious divorce (role number HA SA 22-816) and on October 7, 2022 the woman has summoned the manIn the present procedure.
2.8.
The oral treatment in the present procedure is then added with the oral treatment of the procedures with the roll numbers HA SA 22-810 and HA SA 22-816.
2.9.
In the procedures with roll numbers HA SA 220-810 and HA SA 22-816, judgment will be given on the date of this judgment.
2.10.
On May 31, 2022, the woman submitted a (new) divorce request to this court.
3.
The dispute
3.1.
In these proceedings, the woman claims that the court, as far as possible, enforceable in stock:
I. The man condemns on the basis of Article 431 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure to what has been determined in the judicial decision of the family court of the AHWAZ district in Iran dated 16 June 2019;
Ii.stipulates that the man owes the equivalent in euros to the wife of
what the man was convicted of, namely the equivalent of 514
full Bahar Azadi coins or an amount of EUR 433,995.90, if the man does not proceed with payment of what he was convicted of under I. within fourteen days after service of the judgment to be displayed in this judgment;With conviction of the man in the costs of these proceedings.
3.2.
The man defends and concludes the inadmissibility of the woman in her claims, at least rejection of those claims, with the order of the woman in the costs of the proceedings, all that is enforceable in stock.
4.
The assessment
4.1.
The man has argued that it is not certain that the woman's lawyer is authorized to perform on behalf of the woman.The woman's lawyer, however, stated at the hearing that he is authorized to perform on behalf of the woman.The court is based on the accuracy of this statement and therefore ignores this defense of the man.
4.2.
There is no treaty between the Netherlands and Iran in which the mutual recognition of judicial decisions is regulated.The Iranian verdict can therefore not be recognized and implemented via the Exequature Procedure of Article 431 (1) in combination with Article 985 and the following RV.It is, however, possible that on the basis of the second paragraph of Article 431 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure, the Dutch court grants the Iranian judgment to the Iranian judgment, in the sense that the man is sentenced to what he has been sentenced to in the Iranian verdict.This is called a quasi-exequatur.The woman's claim in this procedure is focused on this.
4.3.
This procedure shows coincidence with the procedure mentioned above under 2.6 with role number HA SA 22-810, in which the woman claims that the court, on the basis of a substantive testing of her claim, condemns the man to transfer 514 Bahar Azadi Gold Coins or aEquivalent of this equal to € 433,995.90.At the hearing, the woman indicated that the claim in the present procedure must be regarded as its primary claim, and the claim in the procedure with roll number HA SA 22-810 as a subsidiary claim.If the claim in the present procedure is granted, the woman will withdraw the claim in the case with roll number HA SA 22-810.The court understands that the woman requires a decision in the present proceedings, and only requires a decision in the procedure with roll number HA SA 22-810 if the court decides to the disadvantage of the woman in the present proceedings.
4.4.
The Dutch court is competent to take cognizance of the dispute in the present proceedings.Article 431, paragraph 2, of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure creates jurisdiction for the Dutch court.This is not disputed by the man.Nor is the relative jurisdiction of this court disputed.The court therefore considers itself competent to take cognizance of the woman's claims.
4.5.
When assessing the question of whether a foreign court can be granted under Article 431 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court must test that decision against a number of (formal) conditions as listed in the so -called Gazprombank arrest (HR 26 September 2014, ECLI: NL: HR: 2014: 2838), including the condition that the foreign decision was made in legal procedure that meets the requirements of proper and sufficient guarantees.The requirements of a considerable process of process is - in any case where it concerns a default judgment - a considerable and timely convocation.This follows from the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (cf. EHRM 7 July 2007, no. 66941/01 (Zagorodnikov t. Russia)).
4.6.
The woman stated by summons that the man was fully aware of the procedure in Iran and that the Iranian verdict was pointed out for contradiction.This has been disputed by the man.The man pointed out that the Iranian verdict itself shows that it has been mentioned in absentia.The man also argued that (for him) it is unclear how the procedure in Iran was conducted by the woman, that he does not have meanings and that an incorrect address is mentioned in the Iranian judgment (namely an address in Iran while whileHe lived and lived in the Netherlands).At the hearing, the woman stated that it is indeed a default judgment, but that the man was aware of the procedure.
4.7.
In the opinion of the court, the woman cannot suffice that the man was aware of the procedure.In the light of the motivated dispute by the man on this point (and in particular the fact that apparently mentioned an incorrect address as the place of residence of the man in the Iranian judgment), it was on the wife's way to say facts that show thatThat the introductory procedural documents are legally and timely served to the man, so that he has had sufficient opportunity to defend.The woman did not do that.The woman has thus insufficiently substantiated her positions.The woman has therefore not met her obligation to settle under Article 150 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure and the claim must be rejected.
4.8.In view of the relationship between parties (former sponsors), the court will determine that everyone bears their own costs.
5.
The decision
The court
5.1.
rejects the progress;
5.2.
compensates for the costs of this procedure between the parties, in the sense that each party bears its own costs
