judgment of 22 July 2020 of the single Chamber in the case between
[plaintiff]
, residing in [hometown], plaintiff
authorized representative: A. Hashem Jawaheri, lawyer in Amsterdam,
and
The daily management of Werkplein Hart van West-Brabant, defendant.
Process
In the decision of 24 June 2019 (primary decision), Werkplein rejected the claimant's application for social assistance benefits.
In the decision of 9 September 2019 (contested decision), Werkplein declared the plaintiff's objection to the decision of 24 June 2019 unfounded.
Plaintiff has appealed against the contested decision.
Werkplein has submitted a statement of defense.
The appeal was discussed at the court hearing on 5 February 2020. The plaintiff, her authorized representative, and P. Neeleman and [representative] were present on behalf of Werkplein.
The court suspended the investigation at the hearing and it was agreed that the plaintiff will hand in income data for the months of May and June 2019 at Werkplein, so that it can be checked whether the plaintiff is entitled to social assistance benefits over those months.
The parties submitted additional documents, after which the court concluded the investigation on 10 June 2020.
Consideration
1.
Facts
From 1 September 2018 to 10 December 2018, the plaintiff had a unemployment benefit and a benefit under the Surcharge Act.She had a
SW benefit.
On February 14, 2019, the plaintiff contacted Werkplein by telephone.She then spoke with Mrs. [employee], who - as far as is currently relevant - has recorded the following in the contact registration of Werkplein:
“Mrs. calls to ask for the state of affairs of request for relocation costs.[...] She has ZW but does not receive Surcharges Act.Advised that she will first apply for this today.If that is rejected, or are granted but too low, it will still report for additional PW.[...] ”
Data from Suwinet shows that no Surcharge Act has been granted.Inquiries by Werkplein at the UWV has shown that the plaintiff did not apply for a supplement to her SW benefit on the basis of the Surcharge Act.
On March 28, 2019, the plaintiff reported to Werkplein for social assistance benefits.
On 12 April 2019, the plaintiff applied for the social assistance benefit as of 1 November 2018.
In the decision of 24 June 2019, Werkplein rejected the claimant's application.
This is because her income from work at the time of her report was higher than the standard applicable to her.Werkplein has also rejected the requested retroactive power of the assistance.Awarding a retroactive benefit can actually only be done if there are special circumstances for this.According to Werkplein they are not in this case.
In the contested decision, Werkplein maintained the decision of 24 June 2019.
2.
Plaintry position
The plaintiff has argued, in summary, that she meets all the conditions for a benefit due to her limited assets.Werkplein wrongly only looked at her income in the month of April 2019. No variable income has been taken into account.She has made it sufficiently plausible that she does not enjoy a fixed income.Moreover, April is not the desired entrance month, but November 2018. Werkplein has not motivated why its variable income is not taken into account and why only the month of April 2019 is being looked at.Plaintiff had telephone contact with Werkplein in November 2018.It was then promised that from October it will be eligible for the benefit with effect from October.Plaintiff was justified on this communication.Pursuant to Article 44 of the Participation Act, it is entitled to assistance from that contact time.There is also a harrowing situation and special, unforeseen circumstances.She appeals to an urgent necessity because she has the care of 3 young children.For medical reasons, she was never before representing her interests.

Judgment of the court
3.1
This case concerns 2 things: (1) with retroactive assistance for the period from November 1, 2018 to March 28, 2019 and (2) assistance from the reporting date
March 28, 2019.
Retroactive power of the assistance
3.2The starting point is that a social assistance benefit is not granted until the date on which someone has reported for social assistance benefits.This principle can be deviated from if there are special circumstances.In this context, the plaintiff has invoked the principle of trust, but in the opinion of the court that appeal does not succeed.
3.3
According to the plaintiff, she contacted Werkplein by telephone in November 2018 because her income (WW and Surcharge Act) was too low.She was then referred to the UWV and the UWV would have referred her to Werkplein (cupboard to the wall).However, there is no evidence in the procedural documents that the plaintiff contacted Werkplein in November 2018, let alone that Werkplein would have promised her then that she would be eligible for social assistance benefits from October 2018.
3.4
It is clear, however, that the plaintiff called on 14 February 2019 with Mrs. [employee] van Werkplein.The plaintiff received a SW benefit at that time, but no Surcharge Act.It was then told the plaintiff that she had to go to the UWV to request Surcharge Act.If she did not get that or if that would (still) be too low, the plaintiff would still report for additional assistance.The problem for the plaintiff, however, is that she did not follow the advice of Mrs. [employee].Now that it has been established that the plaintiff did not apply for Surcharge Act from the UWV if, in the opinion of the court, she would not be confident that she would receive assistance retroactively until 14 February 2019.
Assistance from March 28, 2019 (Date report)
3.5
Because the assessment period runs from 28 March 2019 to 24 June 2019 (Date of Primary Decree), Werkplein must look at that entire period whether the plaintiff is eligible for assistance.So not only the month of April, but also needs to be looked at whether the plaintiff may still be eligible for assistance at a later time.
3.6
In the primary decision, Werkplein has made a calculation that means that the plaintiff had income from work in March and April 2019 that were above the social assistance standard.Plaintiff did not challenge that calculation, so that the court assumes its accuracy.This means that the plaintiff is not entitled to assistance for both months.
3.7
The court suspended the investigation at the hearing and it was agreed that the plaintiff would hand in income data for the months of May and June 2019 at Werkplein, so that the plaintiff was able to see whether the plaintiff is entitled to social assistance benefits over those months.
3.7.1
Plaintiff sent payslips and bank statements to Werkplein on 7 February 2020.Based on this, in his letter of 13 March 2020, Werkplein indicated to the plaintiff's authorized representative that the total income of the plaintiff for the month of May 2019 was € 1,794.83 and for the month of June 2019 € 1,517.95.Because the social assistance standard applicable to the plaintiff was € 974.27 excluding holiday allowance, Werkplein concludes that the plaintiff is also not entitled to social assistance for the months of May and June 2019.
3.7.2 By fax letter of 6 May 2020, the authorized representative of the plaintiff informed the court in response to the letter from Werkplein of 13 March 2020 that he has no comments on that letter, so that the court will assume the accuracy thereof.The plaintiff is therefore not entitled to assistance for the months of May and June 2019.
